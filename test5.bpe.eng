Erdogan States Turkey to Re@@ j@@ ect any Pres@@ su@@ res to Ur@@ ge it to Rec@@ o@@ gn@@ ize Cyprus
Ankara 12-@@ 1 ( AFP ) - Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced today , Wednesday , that Ankara will reject any pressure by the European Union to urge it to recognize Cyprus . this comes two weeks before the summit of European Union state and government heads who will decide whether or nor membership negotiations with Ankara should be opened .
Erdogan told " NTV " television station that " the European Union cannot address us by imposing new conditions on us with regard to Cyprus .
we will discuss this dossier in the course of membership negotiations . "
he added " Let me be clear , I cannot si@@ de@@ st@@ ep Turkey , this is something we cannot accept . "
the European Parliament is expected to direct Union heads of state and government on December 14 to agree to opening membership negotiations with Ankara but with specific conditions .
Greece sees Ankara ' s recognition of Cyprus , which is now also a member of the European Union , as a " fundamental condition " to the European Union giving the green light to opening of membership negotiations with Ankara .
Turkey still refuses to recognize the Republic of Cyprus which became a member of the European Union last March 1st but it is the only country in the world to recognize the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus which declared its independence in the northern part of the island .
Erdogan also rejected the notion of opening negotiations to create a special partnership between Turkey and the European Union in place of membership negotiations .
Erdogan said on this subject : " this proposal , which we cannot accept , is not appropriate for a serious organization like the European Union . "
he added : " we want to start negotiations in the first six months of 2005 or in the second half of the year if this is not possible [ ... ] but we cannot set the date for starting negotiations in 2006 . "

American Army des@@ er@@ ter : the Army Killed In@@ no@@ cent People in Iraq
Toronto 12-@@ 8 ( AFP ) - Jeremy Hin@@ z@@ man , a des@@ er@@ ter from the American army and applicant for political asylum in Canada , yesterday , Tuesday , called a witness , a soldier from the Marines , who told the Immigration authorities charged with examining Hin@@ z@@ man ' s file how his unit killed over thirty Iraqi civilians in the course of two days .
in his testimony to the Immigration and Refugee Board , which is looking into the political asylum application made by 26-year-old Hin@@ z@@ man who said he deserted so he would not have to kill innocent people , Sergeant Jimmy Mas@@ sey said " I know we killed innocent people . "
he added that " more than thirty people " were shot by his men at a checkpoint in Baghdad in spring 2003 .
he said that soldiers at that time , fearing suicide attacks , would fire at any car that did not stop at the checkpoint after a hand signal or warning shot .
he said that four cars were subject to such intense fire but that when the people inside them were searched , the soldiers found no evidence that they were transporting anything except poor innocents .
he also said that he saw soldiers killing four isolated demonstrators and that they killed more the next day in the course of a surveillance operation in the Iraqi capital .
Jimmy Mas@@ sey asked " when you do n 't know who the enemy is , what do you do ? " following a nervous breakdown and depression , he was released from military service after 12 years in the army .
Hin@@ z@@ man , who was with the 82nd Airborne division and served in Afghanistan , said that he realized after he volunteered in 2001 that he was incapable of killing a human being .
he traveled to Canada with his wife and son and applied for political asylum , saying that he would be subject to harassment if he were returned to the United States .
Committee for Def@@ ending Saddam Hussein : Red Cross in Geneva ref@@ rains from Meeting Committee Delegation
Amman 12-@@ 16 ( AFP ) - The committee for defending ousted Iraqi president Saddam Hussein announced that officials at the main headquarters of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Geneva refused to meet three of its members yesterday , Wednesday .
Committee spokesman Ziad Kha@@ sa@@ w@@ neh told Agence France-Presse today , Thursday , that " three committee lawyers were to meet with Red Cross officials in Geneva yesterday morning but the latter bowed out shortly before the meeting . "
he said that the three French lawyers traveled to the Committee ' s headquarters in Geneva following an official request by the committee for defending Saddam Hussein .
he said the aim of the visit was " to find out about the condition of President Saddam Hussein and other prisoners and detainees , " pointing out that " the pretext used by the Committee to refuse to meet the delegation is that it does not want to interfere because of conflicting statements " about the condition of Saddam Hussein and his detained associates .
Prime Minister of the interim Iraqi government Ayad Allawi had announced on Tuesday in Baghdad that the " symbolic " trial of Saddam Hussein ' s former regime would begin next week .
Iraqi Defense Minister Hazim al-@@ Shal@@ an announced on Wednesday that Ali Hassan Majid , nicknamed " Chemical Ali " and nephew of Saddam Hussein , would be the first former regime official tried before the court .
the committee for defending the former Iraqi president regards the symbolic trial of the former regime as " null and void " because the lawyers for those indicted were not present when they were interviewed .
the first anniversary of the capture of ousted Iraqi president coincided with conflicting information about senior members of the former regime being on a hunger strike in their secret prison near Baghdad International Airport . Iraqi lawyers confirm this while the American military denies it .
the defense committee announced on Monday that associates of the former Iraqi president were on a hunger strike and attributed this to pressure on senior leaders to make them testify against him but it was not able to confirm whether Saddam himself was also taking part .
the Committee for Def@@ ending the former Iraqi President , whose headquarters are in Amman , includes 23 permanent members and the Libyan leader ' s daughter A@@ isha Muammar Gaddafi and an American lawyer .
Rabat Re@@ j@@ ec@@ ts Ac@@ ts of Terror in Holland Be@@ ing attributed to it
Rabat 12-@@ 16 ( AFP ) - Moroccan Justice Minister , Mr. Mohamed Bou@@ z@@ ou@@ ba@@ a , today , Thursday , rejected the notion that acts of terror in Holland should be attributed to Morocco because the persons accused of carrying out attacks of this kind hold dual Dutch and Moroccan nationality .

the minister added : " this forces me to treat with great caution the Mor@@ oc@@ c@@ ann@@ ess of terrorist acts committed in Holland . "
Bou@@ z@@ ou@@ ba@@ a said that in Spain " some Moroccan detainees are clearly suspected of direct or indirect involvement in planning the si@@ x@@ t@@ e@@ en@@ th of May events , " alluding to the attacks of May 16 , 2003 attacks which killed 45 people among them 12 suicide bombers in Casablanca .
he said : " Moroccan terrorists also have links with foreign networks , Egyptian and Afghan " and that " in fact , this is all to do with the Al-Qaeda network . "

Tulkarem ( West Bank ) 12-@@ 29 ( AFP ) - The head of the executive committee of the Palestinian Liberation Movement , Mahmoud Abbas , said today , Wednesday , that the separation wall and Jewish settlements in the West Bank would not give Israel security .

"
the gathering was held in the soccer stadium 500 km from the separating wall that is being erected by the Jewish state in this area .
the International Court of Justice in The Hague had ruled last July that the wall being erected by Israel in the West Bank is illegal and called for building to be stopped and the dismantling of what has been built .

in his speech , Abbas stressed the terms of his political program such as a fair resolution to the issue of Palestinian refugees , the release of prisoners in Israeli jails and the creation an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital .
Abbas had previously visited Tulkarem camp where he met a number of the families of martyrs and with activists in the pro-@@ Fatah movement ' s Al-Aqsa Brigades which he represents in the elections .

according to the police 50,000 to 60,000 demonstrators took part in the demonstration , which comes before important general elections to be held next May , while the organizers estimated the number of participants at around 100,000 .
Ethiopia and Eritrea were involved in a border war from 1998 to 2000 .
after the peace agreement was signed in 2000 in Algeria , an independent panel drew up new borders between the two countries , giving Eritrea the disputed town of Bad@@ me .
however , Ethiopia rejected this decision in September 2003 and stopped all demarcation operations .

Nairobi 1-@@ 9 ( AFP ) - Sudan Vice President Ali Osman Taha and the leader of the Sudan Popular Liberation Army , the southern rebellion movement , signed the final peace accord on southern Sudan today , Sunday , in Nairobi , according to reports by Agence France-Presse .
Taha and Garang signed the accord in the presence of a number of African heads of state and government and a number of representatives of the international community , among them the American Secretary of State , Colin Powell .

this agreement puts an end to the 21-year civil war , the longest conflict between neighbors on the African continent .
this war broke out in 1983 with the revolt by the Sudan Popular Liberation Army from southern Sudan where the majority of inhabitants are Christian and animists , against the Muslim Arab north .
this dispute has killed at least 1.5 million people and displaced approximately four million people .

however , peace in the south represents a strong motive to drive forward negotiations between the Khartoum government and rebel movements in Darfur .

it added that " a higher rate of immigration may become necessary to fill the needs of the European market . "
however , the Commission stressed that these policies would never decide the number of workers allowed to enter each country , as this would be a matter for national administrations , in accordance with the European constitution project .

European Commissioner for Justice , Freedom and Security Franco Frattini sees that " member states , the European Parliament , trade unions , companies and the many concerned parties have different views on this matter . "
Italy and Spain support the op@@ en@@ -@@ door idea to higher immigration while Germany , which has a high unemployment rate , opposes it .

Iran Den@@ ies Information Con@@ c@@ ern@@ ing Presence of American Commando Groups in Iran
Tehran 1-@@ 19 ( AFP ) - A top Iranian official has denied press information which describes American commando groups infiltrating Iran to identify nuclear sites as possible targets for air raids , said Iranian newspapers today Wednesday .
the spokesman for the Supreme National Security Council , Ali Aga Mo@@ ha@@ me@@ di , said " it would not be possible for any American commando groups to enter Iran this easily for espionage purposes and it would be naive to believe such an idea . "
he added " we know our borders . "
Mo@@ ha@@ me@@ di criticized information in the American New Yorker magazine , saying it was part of a " psychological campaign " against the Islamic republic .
the New Yorker wrote in its latest issue that American commando groups have been carrying out secret reconnaissance missions in Iran since summer 2004 in search of likely nuclear and chemical targets .
in spite of the American defense department ( Pentagon ) denying this information , its publication led to increased speculation about possible American military action to stop Iranian nuclear activities .
the tone of these speculations increased when American President George Bush announced on Monday in an interview with American television network NBC that he does not rule out military action against Iran .
Bush said " I hope we can resolve this problem diplomatically , but I will never rule out any option . "
Ali Aga Mo@@ ha@@ me@@ di said the New Yorker information " is not worthy of discussion . "
he repeated that Iran ' s nuclear program is peaceful and that Iran is not trying to acquire an atomic bomb as the United States claims .
he added " we do not possess nuclear weapons and the International Atomic Energy Agency has inspected Iranian installations . "
former Iranian President Hashimi Rafsanjani , who is still an active figure in the Iranian regime , on Tuesday warned the United States against any military action against Iran .
the Iranian news agency reported Rafsanjani as saying that " threats from our external enemies do not frighten us and they know perfectly well that Iran is an historic Islamic state with a noble history ; it is not a suitable place for ad@@ v@@ ent@@ u@@ res . "

General Wil@@ m@@ hel@@ ms@@ en said in a press conference today , Wednesday , that the success of the mission he is in charge of in the Nuba Mountains ( one of the three areas covered by the peace deal signed on January 9 in Nairobi between Khartoum and southern rebels ) depends on good cooperation between former fighters .
he said that the mechanisms implemented in the Nuba Mountains could be used elsewhere in Sudan after security is established in all regions .
he added that there had been no clashes between armed forces in the Nuba Mountains since the ceasefire was implemented and said that the lessons learned from this experiment would be presented to the United Nations so that they could be used in other areas .
General Wil@@ m@@ hel@@ ms@@ en said the success of the ceasefire has led to a doubling of the number of inhabitants in the area since 2002 , from 7@@ 20,000 to 1.5 million .
he said that life had almost returned to normal , in spite of the mines laid during the war .
on January 5 , the Sudan news agency reported that the United Nations had asked for a 100@@ -day period to take over from the joint military committee in the Nuba Mountains .

British Deputy Prime Minister : Dalian Has S@@ uc@@ c@@ e@@ ed@@ ed In becoming A Modern Industrial City
Dalian December 3 / Xinhua / Dalian has succeeded in changing from an old industrial economy to a modern industrial city , said British Deputy Prime Minister and First Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs John Prescott on a visit here today , Friday .
Prescott made this statement during his meeting with Wang Ching Min , the deputy governor of Dalian , a city in the Li@@ a@@ on@@ i@@ ang province famed for its cl@@ e@@ an@@ lin@@ ess and strength in the old industrial belt in northeastern China .
northeastern China , which includes the provinces of Li@@ a@@ on@@ i@@ ang , Jilin and Heilongjiang , is the largest and oldest industrial base in China .
this region started to fall behind other regions in the nineties because of the large state-owned companies and the depletion of resources .
in 2003 , the central government set up an agenda to revive the old industrial base and plans to invest over 60 million Yuan ( 7.2 billion US dollars ) in the region .
Prescott said that many cities in the north of Britain are similar to cities in the northeast of China in trying to change from a coal or steel based economy to become modern industrial cities .
Dalian is a good example of such a transformation and will lead the whole region ' s transformation to new industries .
Wang said Dalian hopes for increased cooperation with Britain , especially in sea freight business .
Dalian has 71 projects with British investment , mainly in the area of transformation technology , trade and the services industry .
contractual investments are estimated at around 430 million US dollars and actual investments at around 158 million US dollars .
experts : Chinese Economic Growth O@@ ff@@ ers Opportunity And Not Threat To Latin American Countries
Beijing December 5 / Xinhua / Economic and trade relations between China and Latin American countries are growing at a good rate compatible with internationally recognized standards .
as a result , Chinese economic growth is aimed at offering more opportunities and does not constitute a threat to Latin American countries .
this is what Sung Xiao Ping , deputy head of the Institute of Latin American Studies , part of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences , said in a press interview with Xinhua ' s correspondent on the fringes of an international symposium which opened today , Friday , in the Chinese capital Beijing .
Sung said in the symposium entitled " China ' s Renaissance ... Opportunity and Challenges for Latin America and Asia " that Chinese economic growth is like a train ha@@ ul@@ ing along international economic growth .
as for the Latin American countries , China is a driving force stimulating Latin American economic growth now and in the future .
he quoted a report issued by the Latin American Economic Panel stating that the surging growth of the Chinese economy and the increase in China ' s imports from Latin America in recent years have greatly stimulated a revival of the Latin American economy , such that China has become the third largest importer and fourth largest exporter to Latin America .
this expert added that , on one the hand , the increased rate of Chinese economic growth lays a good foundation for Chinese-@@ Latin American trade development and , on the other hand , Latin America has come out of the economic crisis which erupted in the late nineties and has overcome a period of economic stagnation .
all this constitutes an opportunity for the development of economic and trade relations between the two sides and promising progress in these relations can be expected over the next five to ten years .

Baghdad December 5 / Xinhua / Iraq ' s Justice Minister Malik Dohan al-Hassan expressed his fear of civil war breaking out in Iraq if the interim government continues to insist on holding Iraqi elections on the scheduled date at the end of next January .
in statements on American radio station Su@@ wa on Sunday night , Malik al-Hassan expressed his support for some Iraqi parties ' call for postponement of the elections until the security situation in Iraq becomes stable and said that the time is not right for elections to be held .

COMESA gives us some power with which we can negotiate .
COMESA can negotiate better than Uganda . "
Zambia ' s President Lev@@ i Mwanawasa , who agreed with Museveni ' s statements , said COMESA represents a regional style of making use of Africa ' s capabilities and creating more opportunities for its peoples .

sources : Marwan Al-@@ Bar@@ gh@@ ou@@ thi ' s Can@@ di@@ d@@ acy For Presidential Elections Ill@@ eg@@ al
Gaza December 11 / Xinhua / Palestinian sources close to the Fatah movement said today , Saturday , that the candidacy of Marwan Al-@@ Bar@@ gh@@ ou@@ thi , the movement ' s secretary-general in the West Bank who is being held in Israeli prisons , is not legal .
the sources , who wished to remain anonymous , said putting forward Al-@@ Bar@@ gh@@ ou@@ thi , who is serving five life sentences in Israel , as a candidate is a " breach one of the terms of Palestinian Authority presidential election law . "
they added that " the law requires that anyone putting themselves forward as a candidate for the Palestinian presidency resign from any post held and that this resignation must be given in writing to the general elections committee , and this especially if they are members of public institutions , judges or security officers and this applies to members of the Palestinian legislative council . "
the sources said that " Hassan Khar@@ isha , the Legislative Council ' s charge d 'affaires , had to withdraw from the presidential elections after he was informed by committee members that he had to choose between continuing to be a member of the Legislative Council or resigning in order to take part in the elections , as stipulated by Palestinian law . "

comment : strange Reference To " Chinese Threat " In Japanese Defense Program
Tokyo December 11 / Xinhua / The Japanese government today , Friday , unveiled a ten-year defense program which un@@ ju@@ st@@ i@@ fi@@ ably describes China as a potential threat , along with the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea .
while Democratic Korea has no diplomatic relations with Tokyo , China is a country with which Japan has signed a peace treaty and has very close economic ties .
in spite of the diplomacy of the wording , a summary of the Japanese defense program said China and Democratic Korea are the only two neighbors that pose a threat to it .
the document released by the Japanese government on Friday said " it is necessary to monitor China ' s nuclear and ballistic missile programs , its modernization of the navy and air forces and its attempts to expand naval activities . "
China and Japan normalized their relations 32 years ago .
in addition to the Peace and Friendship Treaty signed six years later , the two countries agreed to update their relations in order to make this a partnership in 1998 .
over the past three decades , trade between them has increased by 130 times and is expected to reach 150 million US dollars this year .
China may become Japan ' s largest trading partner in the very near future .
the total value of Japanese investments in China amounts to 46 billion dollars .
the great complementarity between the economies of these two states has made long-term friendship and peace between China and Japan all the more important , not only for the two countries , but also for peace and prosperity in East Asia and the world in general .
in this context , it is hard to understand why Japan considers China a source of threat .
Hosoda Hiroyuki , Japan ' s chief cabinet secretary , tried to play down the " China threat " issue .
he told reporters today , Friday , that the new defense program did not refer to China as a threat but as a country that deserves Japanese attention in the area of security .
comment : strange Reference To " Chinese Threat " In Japanese Defense Program / First and Last Ad@@ di@@ tion /
however , his explanation did not convince even the Japanese media which said this was the first time the Japanese defense program has mentioned a " Chinese threat " albeit in an indirect manner .
the Japanese government ' s move to expose the " Chinese threat " goes against the two peoples ' aspirations for permanent peace and friendship .
the Chinese Foreign Ministry ' s spokeswoman , Zhang Z@@ he Qiyue , said that China has expressed its " strong dissatisfaction " with the Japanese move and said that " it is totally unjustified and extremely irresponsible . "
it is well-known that the Chinese people are peace-loving .
a stronger China will not be a threat to any other country . to the contrary , it contributes constructively to the development of its neighbors and to regional and international stability and prosperity .
China hopes Japan will take into consideration its Asian neighbors ' concerns and strive to be cautious in military and security policies .
Japan must commit to the path of peace and contribute to regional peace and development .
it should be noted that Japan appears to be following the United States in security strategy .
Japan might be changing its defense priorities to counter-terrorism after the September 11 attacks and strengthening its defense capacity against what it calls the " Democratic Korea threat . "
however , its unbelievable enthusiasm for a missile defense system in cooperation with the United States reveals its true intentions .
it is extremely un@@ convincing at all that such a missile defense system is designed for the above-mentioned purposes only .

spokesman : United States Will Not Red@@ u@@ ce Military Presence In Afghanistan
Kabul December 13 / Xinhua / The United States denied reports today , Monday , concerning the likelihood of cutting its troops in Afghanistan .
mark McCann , Allied spokesman , told journalists here " we are here to help Afghanistan drive out the terrorist threat and secure a stable and peaceful future .
we intend to stay here until we finish our job . "
on the basis of previous news , General David Bar@@ no , commander-in-chief of the Allied forces led by the United States , anticipated the Pentagon cutting its troops once the current peace mission is accomplished .

he added " General David Bar@@ no ' s comment simply describes this process and is not an attempt to predict a particular outcome .
the American commander said he was in agreement with the opinion that there are still elements intent on destruction and and who wish to disrupt the country ' s stability .
allied forces , controlled by the United States , have been on the increase constantly since they were deployed in Afghanistan three years ago , after the fall of the Taliban in 2001 .
the Afghan government , as well as the American administration , announced an amnesty for Taliban militia but the movement ' s spokesman Abdullatif Hak@@ imi turned down the offer and described it as a " ploy to divide the militia " and pledged to fight until the end .

Chinese Scientists discover Din@@ os@@ a@@ ur@@ -@@ E@@ ating m@@ am@@ m@@ al
Beijing January 13 / Xinhua / According to a report published today , Thursday , Chinese scientists have discovered a f@@ os@@ s@@ ili@@ zed din@@ os@@ a@@ ur@@ -@@ eating m@@ am@@ m@@ al in the province of Liaoning in northeast China .
the discovery made by Hu Yao Ming , Wang Yuan Ching and Li Chuan Ku@@ i , all from the Pal@@ e@@ on@@ t@@ ology and Pal@@ e@@ o@@ an@@ th@@ ro@@ pol@@ o@@ g@@ y Institute at the Chinese Academy of Sciences , and Ming Jin from the Museum of Nature in New York , was published in a paper in the British journal Nature .
the f@@ os@@ s@@ ili@@ zed m@@ am@@ m@@ al lived in the Middle era .
this discovery reveals that some l@@ arg@@ e-@@ sized mammals which lived in that era may have been car@@ ni@@ v@@ or@@ ous and brave enough to compete with dinosaurs for food and living space .
Li said the und@@ ig@@ est@@ ed bones , including teeth and limbs , of a small dinosaur were found in its stomach .
he added that un@@ broken jo@@ in@@ ts mean the m@@ am@@ m@@ al tore apart and de@@ v@@ ou@@ red its prey , without biting or ch@@ ew@@ ing .
he said that prior to this latest discovery , most scientists assumed that mammals in the Middle era were fairly small and active at night .
it was assumed that they fed on insects and would not dare to approach dinosaurs .
he said the recent discoveries challenge this view , held for a long time , and prove that some primitive mammals were larger than medium-sized dinosaurs .
scientists had previously believed that they ate small animals and came out in broad daylight .
on the basis of this analysis , the dinosaur de@@ v@@ ou@@ red was one-third of the size of the m@@ am@@ m@@ al .
Russia Se@@ es Final Peace Treaty With Japan As Long@@ -T@@ er@@ m Pro@@ sp@@ ec@@ t
Moscow January 13 / Xinhua / Russia ' s foreign ministry said today , Thursday , that a peace treaty with Japan to formally end enmity between the two countries dating back to World War II is a long-term prospect .
Interfax news agency quoted Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Alexeyev as saying that " this work is going on and will continue to go on .
it is complicated work and may take a long time . "
Alexeyev ' s comment came on the eve of Japanese Foreign Minister Nobutaka Machimura ' s visit to Moscow which is expected to pave the way for Russian President Vladimir Putin ' s planned trip to Japan later this year .
Russia and Japan have yet to sign a peace treaty to end wartime hostilities because of a continuing dispute over four islands near northern Japan annexed by the Soviet Union in the final days of World War II .
Russia recently offered to give Japan back two of the islands , known as the Southern Kur@@ iles in Russia and as the Northern Territories in Japan , after the peace treaty is signed , citing a joint declaration signed in 1956 between the Soviet Union and Japan .
Japan asked for all four islands , which stretch from northern Japan to the tip of the Russian Kam@@ sh@@ at@@ ka peninsula in the far east , to be given back , saying that this was a pre@@ face to signing the peace treaty .
during Machimura ' s visit to Moscow , the two sides are expected to discuss the half-@@ c@@ ent@@ u@@ ry@@ -@@ old regional dispute and preparations for Putin ' s visit to Japan , in addition to joint economic cooperation , according to Itar-Tass news agency .
it is expected that other issues will be discussed including the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea and Iraq .
