Erdogan Con@@ firms Turkey Will Re@@ si@@ st Any Pres@@ sure to Rec@@ o@@ gn@@ ize Cyprus
Ankara 12-@@ 1 ( AFP ) - The Turkish head of government , Recep Tayyip Erdogan , announced today ( Wednesday ) that Ankara would resist any pressure the European Union might exercise in order to force it into recognizing Cyprus . this comes two weeks before a summit of European Union heads of state and government , who will decide whether or not to open membership negotiations with Ankara .
Erdogan said to the NTV television channel : " the European Union cannot engage with us through imposing new conditions on us with regard to Cyprus .
we shall discuss this issue in the course of the membership negotiations . "
he added : " let me be clear - I cannot confine Turkey . this is something we do not accept . "
it is expected that on the 14th December the European Parliament will recommend that the heads of state and government of the European Union agree to open membership negotiations with Ankara , but on clearly defined conditions .
Greece considers Ankara ' s recognition of Cyprus , which has also become a member of the European Union , to constitute " an a pri@@ ori condition " for the European Union to give the green light to opening membership negotiations with Ankara .
Turkey still refuses to recognize the Republic of Cyprus , which became a member of the European Union on the first of May ; but it is the only state in the world to have recognized the " The Turkish Republic of North Cyprus " which declared its own independence on the north of the island .
likewise , Erdogan has refused the proposition of opening negotiations to create a privileged partnership between Turkey and the European Union as an alternative to membership negotiations .
on this subject , Erdogan said that " this suggestion , which we cannot accept , is not worthy of a serious institution such as the European Union " .
he added : " we want negotiations to begin in the first six months of 2005 , or in the second part of the year if that is not feasible ( .. ) but we cannot set a date to begin negotiations in 2006 " .

the United States presented on December 1 two extradition requests for Rodriguez , nicknamed " The Ch@@ ess Player , " and his brother .
in Florida and New York the two brothers face an indictment that alleges the import of cocaine into the United States , laundering hundreds of millions of dollars and the obstruction of justice from 1990 through July 2002 .
in Florida , the Drug Enforcement Administration refused to comment on Colombia ' s decision .

the agency stated that the king of Bahrain met with King Fahd bin Abdul Aziz and Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah Ben Abdul Aziz . he held talks with the latter on " the outline of events in the Gulf , Arab , Islamic and international arenas " . the situation in Iraq and the latest developments in the Palestinian issue topped the agenda .

speaking at the " security and dialogue in the Gulf " conference in Manama , organized by the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London , Al-Faisal said , " It is worrying to see some members of the GCC forge separate bilateral agreements with international powers in both the security and economic spheres , taking precedence over the need to act collectively " .
US Army des@@ er@@ ter : army Killed In@@ no@@ cent Ci@@ v@@ ili@@ ans in Iraq
Toronto 12-@@ 8 ( AFP ) A former US Marine appeared yesterday as a witness to support claims by 26-year-old Jeremy Hin@@ z@@ man , a US army des@@ er@@ ter seeking refugee status in Canada , and told immigration authorities how his platoon killed more than 30 Iraqi civilians in just two days .
giving testimony before Canada ' s Immigration and Refugee Board , set up to consider the merits of Hin@@ z@@ man ' s refugee claim that he fled because he refused to kill innocent civilians , Sergeant Jimmy Mas@@ sey said , " I do know that we killed innocent civilians " .
he added that in the spring of 2003 men under his command killed " more than 30 " civilians while on checkpoint duty in Baghdad .
he told the tribunal that at the time , soldiers feared suicide bombings , so they would shoot at vehicles which ignored hand signals and one shot warnings at checkpoints .
he said that one time , after soldiers rained fire into four cars , searches found no evidence that those killed were anything but poor innocent civilians .
he also recalled watching soldiers kill four unarmed demonstrators and more Iraqis the next day during a spell of checkpoint duty in the Iraqi capital .
" when you do n 't know who the enemy is , what are you doing there ? " asked Jimmy Mas@@ sey , who after being diagnosed with post-@@ tra@@ um@@ ati@@ c stress and severe depression , was hon@@ or@@ ably discharged after 12 years ' service .
Hin@@ z@@ man , who was in the 82nd Airborne Division and served in Afghanistan , said that he realized after joining the army in 2001 that he was not capable of killing another person .
he fled to Canada with his wife and son to claim asylum , and said he would face persecution if returned to the United States .
Saddam Hussein ' s Defense Committee : Red Cross in Geneva rejected Meeting with Committee ' s Delegation
Amman 12-@@ 16 ( AFP ) - The committee for the defense of the deposed Iraqi president Saddam Hussein has announced that officials at the principal headquarters of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Geneva yesterday ( Wednesday ) refused to meet with three of its members .
the committee ' s spokesman , Ziad Kha@@ sa@@ w@@ n@@ ah , said to Agence France-Presse today ( Thursday ) " three of the committee ' s lawyers were supposed to meet officials at the Red Cross in Geneva yesterday morning , but they ex@@ c@@ used themselves shortly beforehand " .
he explained that the three French lawyers had headed for the organization ' s headquarters in Geneva on the basis of an official request from Saddam Hussein ' s defense committee .
he said the aim of the visit had been to get " information on the state of President Saddam Hussein and the other prisoners and detainees " , indicating that " the reason which the Committee put forward for refusing to meet the delegation was that it did not want to interfere in the light of the presence of conflicting statements " about the state of Saddam Hussein and his imprisoned aides .
the president of the Iraqi interim government , Ayad Allawi , announced in Baghdad on Tuesday that the trial of " the symbols " of Saddam Hussein ' s former regime would begin in the coming week .
Iraqi Defense Minister Hazem Shaalan announced on Wednesday that Ali Hassan Al-Majid , nicknamed " Chemical Ali " , the nephew of Saddam Hussein , would be the first of the former regime ' s officials to come before the judges .
the committee for the defense of the former Iraqi president considered the trial of the symbols of the former regime to be " void " , in view of the fact that the accused ' s lawyers had not attended their examinations .
the first anniversary of the arrest of the deposed Iraqi president has coincided with conflicting information regarding the hunger strike of leading figures in the former regime inside their secret prison near to Baghdad International Airport , ranging from the confirmation of the Iraqi lawyers to the denial of the American military .
on Monday the defense committee had announced the hunger strike of aides to the former Iraqi president , laying the blame on pressure exercised on leading figures to compel them to stand witness against him , but were unable to confirm whether Saddam himself was participating .
the defense committee for the former Iraqi president , which has taken Amman for its headquarters , includes 23 permanent members , among them the daughter of the Libyan leader , A@@ isha Muammar Gaddafi , and an American lawyer .

a 60-year-old public housing ten@@ ant had filed a lawsuit accusing the government of disregarding the public interest , which impeded the sale and embarrassed Tung ' s administration , which although under Beijing ' s protection , faces public demands for democratic reform .
for the second year running , hundreds of thousands of people rallied on the anniversary of Hong Kong ' s return to China on July 1st , to demand the next president and members of the legislature be elected through universal suffrage .

" of course self-restraint is required , but only if the perpetrator is not the occupier . however , if the perpetrator is the occupier and his leaders , there is no need for self-restraint , " he said .
the Shiite leader called on " the honorable Muslims " of Najaf and Kerbala , as well as the capital Baghdad , whose mosques have been attacked " to form delegations to go to their scholars and inform them that they are completely prepared , if Allah wills , and after that I would be ready to offer help " .

over 50 Thousand Pro@@ t@@ est@@ ers in Addis Ababa Against Meles Zenawi ' s Peace Plan With Eritrea
Addis Ababa 1-2 ( AFP ) - More than 50 thousand people demonstrated today in Addis Ababa protesting at peace plans proposed by Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi to resolve border disputes with Eritrea , an Agence France-Presse correspondent reported .

Ethiopia and Eritrea fought a border war from 1998 to 2000 .
following a peace treaty signed in Algiers in 2000 , an independent commission drew the new borders between the two countries , attributing the disputed village of Bad@@ me to Eritrea .
however , Ethiopia dismissed the ruling in September 2003 and suspended the demarcation process .
in late November the Ethiopian prime minister proposed a peace plan and accepted " in principle " the demarcation put forward by the commission , but with some " modification " .
accordingly , Asmara accused Addis Ababa of buying time and demanded the start of the process of physically marking out the border .
Be@@ y@@ en@@ en Petros , deputy chairman of the Ethiopian United Democratic Front ( opposition ) , said , " We call on the public to pressure the government into withdrawing its anti-@@ people and anti-@@ national peace initiative . "
he added , " There is no reason to accept the new initiative , which is based on excessive giving
" we have no reason to give an inch of our territory to Eritrea . "
" I call upon the Ethiopian people to vote against the prime minister and demand a new government that will put forward a new peace initiative , " said Ge@@ br@@ u As@@ rate , another opposing official .
Eritrea had been an Ethiopian province until it gained independence in 1993 .

Ramallah ( West Bank ) 1-3 ( AFP ) - One of the candidates running for president of the Palestinian Authority has accused the Palestinian leadership of " failing " to defend the " just " Palestinian cause over the long past years .
independent Islamist candidate Sayyed Hussein Bar@@ ak@@ ah , 48 , told ag@@ ence France-Presse , " There has been a kind of failure in presenting our demands .

Bar@@ ak@@ ah who , before announcing his participation in the elections , worked as a general director in the Palestinian Youth and Sport Ministry , had also had organizational links with the Islamic Jihad movement , but has asserted that he cut ties with the movement in mid 1991 .
he said that following the announcement of President Yasser Arafat ' s death , he prepared a memorandum for both the Hamas and the Islamic Jihad movements presenting his idea of the importance of participating in the upcoming presidential elections .
" the response to my memorandum was Hamas and Islamic Jihad ' s announcement that they would not take part in the elections , neither by running nor voting , and that they would not support anyone , " he said .
after that , he decided to nominate himself for the presidential elections , pointing out that he had already succeeded in the elections before even running in them , by what he described as " relative support for him among Palestinians " .
he expects to play a future role in the Islamic movement scope in the Palestinian territories , even if he does not win the elections .

Strasbourg 1-@@ 11 ( AFP ) - The European Commission today launched a debate on the options for a new policy for economic migration to the European Union aimed at covering the expected shortfall in labor as the European population ages .
the debate will take place through a " Green Paper " which will be distributed to all EU members , the social partners and NGOs to issue their proposals and views by April 15 , so as to enable the Commission to present a policy plan before the end of the year .
the Commission has stated that between " 2010 and 2030 , if present immigration rates continue , the number of work@@ ing-@@ age people in the 25 EU countries will fall by 20 million " .
it added that " larger immigration flows could become more and more necessary to meet European market needs " .
however , the Commission has confirmed that these procedures will not specify the number of workers to be admitted to each country , as it is the responsibility of national administrations , as per the European Constitution Project .
the Commission , however , pointed out that the decision to admit foreigners to one EU country will in turn affect the other EU countries because of the freedom of movement allowed within the " Schengen " area , as well as the right to benefit from services in the other countries , etc .
the Commission has also proposed establishing unified criteria for allowing immigration , in harmony with the will of Member States to the largest extent possible .
the Commissioner responsible for Justice , Freedom and Security , Franco Frattini is aware " that Member States , European Parliament , trade unions , employers and numerous stakeholders have different points of view on this issue " .
while Italy and Spain support the idea of opening the door to more immigration , Germany , which has a high unemployment rate , is against it .
the Commission had adopted a proposal for a directive to unify the conditions of entry and residence in the European Union of this type of legal immigrants , which was unsuccessful .

Abdul Sam@@ ei Khalil Je@@ bara Al-@@ E@@ be@@ idi , the deputy general secretary , said at a press conference , held at the Babel Hotel in central Baghdad , that " the decision to pull out came because of the arrest of the General Secretary of the Front Sheikh Hassan Zeidan Khalaf al-@@ La@@ hi@@ bi last December 26 by US troops " .
" the elections do not seem to be a matter of concern to the Americans , and there seems to be no immunity for any official of a political body that has an electoral list , which he himself heads , " he added .
Al-@@ E@@ be@@ idi pointed out that " there are also a number of other reasons for our decision to withdraw " , mainly " the deterioration of the security situation throughout the country " .
" we previously requested a six-month postponement of the elections , but our request was not approved , " he said .
Al-@@ E@@ be@@ idi added that his party " presented a copy of the withdrawal decision in a memorandum to the Independent Electoral Commission " .

General Secretary of the National Front for the Union of Iraq Hassan Zeidan Khalaf al-@@ La@@ hi@@ bi , 58 , headed the Iraqi Military Academy , which consists of four military colleges , one of which is an engineering college . he also occupied a number of military posts during the former Iraqi regime and obtained the rank of lieutenant general in 1996 .

London Ab@@ and@@ ons " For Good " S@@ pl@@ it@@ ting Sovereignty over Gibraltar
Madrid 1-@@ 12 ( AFP ) - Gibraltar ' s Chief Minister Peter Caruana announced today in Cad@@ iz that London had abandoned " for good " the principle of splitting sovereignty between Spain and Britain over the area .
Caruana said at a press conference held in Cad@@ iz ( And@@ alu@@ sia ) that Britain had abandoned " for good " the principle of sharing sovereignty with Spain because it had been " bad for both Gibraltar and Spain " .
he stressed that Gibraltar , like Spain , supports the dec@@ ol@@ on@@ ization of the area .
however , he stated , " We believe the implementation of self-government is necessary , while Spain wants to reclaim the area " .
Caruana considered that both British and Spanish authorities had realized that their attempts to resolve the issue of Gibraltar ' s sovereignty bilaterally " are doomed to failure because it is a violation of the dignity of Gibraltar ' s population " .
in November 2002 , 98.@@ 97 % of Gibraltar ' s 20 thousand 500 voters said in a referendum that they wanted to remain British .
on December 17 , Spain , Britain and Gibraltar announced the establishment of " a forum of dialogue involving Gibraltar " , where Spain for the first time agreed that Gibraltar ' s government should enjoy self-determination , in line with London and Madrid .
but Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero declared December 18 that Madrid insisted on its demand for sovereignty over Gibraltar .
he said that this demand is an " issue that Spain will not cede .
it is a basic principle " .
the British colony of Gibraltar , with an area of six square kilometers , lies in the south of Spain , at the entrance of the strait that connects the Atlantic Ocean with the Mediterranean Sea .
Spain ceded it to Britain in the 17@@ 13 Treaty of Utrecht .

Iran Den@@ ies Reports on Presence of US Com@@ man@@ dos in Iran
Tehran 1-@@ 19 ( AFP ) - A senior Iranian official has dismissed a report that US commandos have infiltrated Iran to select nuclear sites for possible air strikes , Iranian newspapers reported today .
spokesman for the Supreme National Security Council Ali Agha Mohammadi said , " No commandos are able to enter Iran so easily to spy . it would be naive to accept such an idea . "
" we know our borders , " he added .
Mohammadi criticized the report by the American " New Yorker " magazine , dismissing it as part of a " psychological campaign " against the Islamic republic .
the " New Yorker " wrote that US commandos had been conducting covert reconnaissance missions inside Iran since the summer of 2004 to search out potential nuclear and chemical targets .
although the US Defense Ministry ( the Pentagon ) has rejected the report , speculations regarding a potential US attack to stop Iranian nuclear activities have mounted .
speculations mounted even more when US President George Bush announced Monday in an interview with US television network " NBC " that he could not rule out military action against Iran .
Bush said , " I hope we can solve it diplomatically , but I w@@ o n 't ever take any option off the table . "
Mohammadi said the New Yorker report " was not even worth thinking about " .
he reiterated that the Iranian nuclear program is peaceful and that Iran is not working on a nuclear bomb , as the United States alleges .
" we have no nuclear weapons . the International Atomic Energy Agency has searched Iranian establishments , " he added .
former Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani , still an influential personality in the Iranian regime , cautioned the United States on Tuesday against thinking of military action against Iran .
the Iranian news agency quoted Rafsanjani as saying , " We are not afraid of foreign enemies ' threats , since they know well that Iran , the Islamic state with its ancient civilization , is no place for adventurism . "

General Wil@@ hel@@ ms@@ en announced today in a press conference that the reason behind the success of the mission he heads in the Nuba Mountains ( one of the three areas included in the January 9 peace accord signed in Nairobi by Khartoum and southern rebels ) was establishing close cooperation between the ex-@@ fighters .
he stressed that the mechanism applied in the Nuba Mountains could be applied in other parts of Sudan after assessing the security situation in each area .
he added that there had been no clashes between armed forces since the beginning of the ceasefire , pointing out that the lessons derived from this experience would be submitted to the United Nations for use in other areas .
General Wil@@ hel@@ ms@@ en said the truce ' s success since 2002 has been translated into the doubling of the area ' s population from 720 thousand to one and a half million people .
he said that life had almost returned to normal , despite the landmines laid during the war .
on January 5 , Sudan News Agency reported that the United Nations had requested a one-@@ hundred day mandate to take over from the Joint Military Commission in the Nuba Mountains .

British Deputy Prime Minister : Dalian Has Man@@ aged to B@@ ec@@ ome a Modern Industrial City
Dalian December 3rd / Xinhua / Dalian has managed to shift from the old industrial economy to a modern industrial city , British Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott said on his visit here today .
Prescott made the statement during his meeting with Wang Chin@@ g@@ -@@ Min , the deputy mayor of Dalian , a city in the province of Liaoning famous for its cl@@ e@@ an@@ lin@@ ess and power in the old industrial belt in north-east China .
the north-east region of China , which comprises the provinces of Liaoning , Jilin and Heilongjiang , is said to be the largest and oldest industrial base in China .
the region began to fall behind other regions in the nineties because of the inflated state-owned companies and the scarcity of resources .
in 2003 the central government planned the revival of the industrial base and the investment of more than 60 billion yu@@ ans ( 7.2 billion US dollars ) in the region .
Prescott said that many cities in the north of Britain are the same as those in north-east China in the sense that they are trying to shift from an economy based on coal and iron to become modern industrial cities .
Dalian sets a good example of this transition and will direct the whole region towards new industries .
Wang said that Dalian hopes to boost cooperation with Britain particularly in the sea shipping business .
Dalian has 71 British investment projects most of which are in the fields of tr@@ an@@ s@@ for@@ m@@ ational industry , trade and the service industry .
contractual investments are estimated at 430 million US dollars and actual investments at about 158 million US dollars .
experts : Chinese Economic Growth O@@ ff@@ ers Opportunity and No Threat to Latin America
Beijing December 5th / Xinhua / Economic and trade ties between China and Latin American countries are booming in line with internationally recognized conventions .
Chinese economic growth can offer more opportunities and poses no threat to Latin American countries .

Abkhazia Hol@@ ds Second Round of Presidential Elections
Moscow December 5th / Xinhua / A source close to Abkhazia ' s Prime Minister Kha@@ zh@@ ba said today that the former presidential candidates of Georgia ' s breakaway republic of Abkhazia , Sergei Bagapsh and Raul Kha@@ j@@ im@@ ba , have agreed to hold the second round of presidential elections , Itar-Tass news agency reported .
the two sides , through the mediation of Prime Minister No@@ dar Kha@@ zh@@ ba and Russian Deputy Prosecutor-General Vladimir Kolesnikov , also agreed to immediately lift the siege of all the state buildings captured by supporters of the two candidates , including the complex of government buildings , the president ' s office and the Abkhazian television and radio company in the cities of P@@ it@@ s@@ unda , T@@ k@@ v@@ ar@@ ch@@ eli and Gu@@ d@@ au@@ ta .
Abkhazia held a presidential vote on October 3 , when Bagapsh collected 4@@ 3,3@@ 36 votes and Kha@@ j@@ im@@ ba 30,@@ 815 votes .
however , a dispute over the results erupted between election rivals , Russian-@@ backed Kha@@ j@@ im@@ ba and opposition leader Bagapsh .
Bagapsh , who insists he won the elections , has said he will hold his inauguration ceremony on Monday as scheduled " despite the pressure put on him " .
Gennady Buk@@ ayev , assistant to Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkov , warned on Wednesday that if any " unconstitutional actions " were taken , Russia would close its border with Abkhazia and take necessary measures to prevent the escalation of violence in the region .
Abkhazia self-proclaimed independence from Georgia in the early nineties after the collapse of the former Soviet Union .

Iraqi Foreign Minister F@@ ears Civil War in Iraq
Baghdad December 5th / Xinhua / Iraqi Justice Minister Malik Dohan Al-@@ Hassan has expressed fear that civil war may break out if the interim government insists on holding the Iraqi elections on schedule in late January .
Malik Al-@@ Hassan , in a release to American ( Su@@ a ) radio on Sunday , voiced his support for some Iraqi parties ' call for the postponement of the elections until the security situation improved , considering that the time was not appropriate to hold elections .
al-Hassan added that leaders and chiefs of tribes in Mosul , Tikrit , Ba@@ q@@ ou@@ ba and Ramadi declined to take part in the elections and called for a boycott if the interim government rejects the demands of the provinces ' residents , calling for the division of Iraq into electoral districts and the representation of provinces in the National Assembly on the basis of population ratio .
he said despite the Iraqi people ' s aspiration for an elected government , so that foreign forces vacate Iraq , it would not be possible to hold the elections amid the current security situation .
the justice minister stated that it would be impossible to guarantee the security of voters on their way to cast ballots , just as it would be impossible to guarantee the security of candidates during election campaign rallies .
a number of leading Sunni Muslim politicians have previously urged the government to postpone the elections for six months in order to give authorities enough time to secure polling stations and to convince Sunni clerics to abandon their call for an election boycott .
a spokesman for the interim Prime Minister Iyad Allawi has said that the government insists on January 30th , after receiving confirmation from the Iraqi Elections Committee that the elections can be held even in Sunni areas wrecked by insurgents .
meanwhile , US President George W. Bush stressed on December 2nd that the Iraqi elections must be held on January 30th as scheduled , saying , " The time has come for Iraqis to head for the polls . "

a US congress committee later accused the international organization of poor management of the program , which it said allowed Saddam Hussein to acquire more than 10 billion dollars in oil revenues .
Annan launched an internal investigation in February , but cancelled it in March to allow for a broader , independent investigation .
the oil-for-food program began in December 1996 to allow Iraq to export 6@@ 9.5 billion US dollars worth of oil .
the United Nations supervised Iraq ' s oil sales and its purchase of humanitarian supplies . the program was shut down in November last year .

sources : candidacy of Marwan Barghouti for Presidential Elections Ill@@ eg@@ al
Gaza December 11th / Xinhua / Palestinian sources close to the Fatah movement today ( Saturday ) said that the candidacy of Marwan Barghouti , the secretary general of the movement in the West Bank who is jailed in Israel , was illegal .
the sources , who asked to remain unnamed , explained that the candidacy of Barghouti who is held in Israel on five life terms " breaks one of the stipulations of the presidential electoral law of the Palestinian National Authority " .
they added : " the law requires anyone wishing to present himself as a candidate to the Palestinian presidential elections to resign from any position he might hold and to submit this written resignation to the general electoral committee , particularly members of public organizations , judges , and security officials , and this applies to members of the Palestinian legislative council . "
the sources explained that " Hassan Khar@@ isha , the acting chief of the legislative council , was forced to withdraw his decision to contest the presidential elections after stating through members of the council that he had to choose between continuing in his membership of the legislative council or submitting his resignation in order to contest the elections , as Palestinian law states . "
the sources confirmed that " the same issue applies to Barghouti , who announced his own candidacy without presenting his resignation from the legislative council , an action counting as a legal infringement , which dis@@ continues his candidacy for these elections . "
sources said that the 10th article relating to candidacy for the post of president states that " the rulings of article / 14 / of this law apply to candidates for the post of president , ex@@ c@@ ep@@ ting the president of the Palestinian National Authority . "
article / 14 / , under the title Can@@ di@@ d@@ acy and the Holding of Public Offices , states that " taking into account the rulings of this law , candidacy may not be accepted from Palestinian National Authority ministers , employees of government or public administration , heads and members of municipal councils , or employees of state institutions active in the area , who do not resign ten days prior to the deadline for the announcement of the final candidates lists , with their resignation being considered acceptable .

comment : bizarre Reference to " Chinese Threat " in Japanese Defense Program
Tokyo December 11th / Xinhua / On Friday the Japanese government revealed a ten-year defense program , which describes China as a probable threat alongside the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea , without offering any justification .
whilst Democratic Korea does not have diplomatic relations with Tokyo , China is a state with which Japan has signed a peace agreement and with which it has highly solid economic relations .
in spite of the diplomacy of the wording , the summary of the Japanese defense program states that China and Democratic Korea are the only neighboring countries to pose a threat .
the document issued by the Japanese government on Friday states that " it is necessary to keep watch over China ' s nuclear and ballistic missile program , its modernization of air and sea forces , and attempts to expand naval activity . "
China and Japan normalized their relations 32 years ago .
in addition to the treaty of peace and friendship which was signed six years after that , the two states agreed to renew their relationship to become one of partnership in 1998 .
on the strength of the three previous treaties , trade between them has increased 13@@ 0-@@ fold , and is expected to reach 150 million US dollars this year .
China may become Japan ' s largest trade partner in the very near future .
total Japanese investment in China stands at 46 million dollars .
the large integration of the two countries ' economies has spilled over into long-term friendship and peace between China and Japan which is of great importance , not only to these two countries , but also with regard to peace and prosperity in East Asia and the world as a whole .
in this context , it is difficult to see why Japan believes that China is a source of threat .
the Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary , Hiroyuki Hosoda , has tried to play down the issue of " the Chinese threat . "
he said to journalists on Friday that the new defense program did not indicate that China was a threat , but that as a state it mer@@ ited Japan ' s attention in the security arena .
comment : bizarre Reference to " Chinese Threat " in Japanese Defense Program / First And Last Ad@@ di@@ tion /
not even the Japanese media is convinced by his explanation , stating that it was the first time the Japanese defense program had referred to the " Chinese threat " , albeit indirectly .
the Japanese government move in bringing out the " Chinese threat " contradicts the two peoples ' ambitions for permanent peace and friendship .
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qi Yue said China expressed " its extreme dissatisfaction " with the Japanese step , saying it was " completely irresponsible and unjustified " .
it is well-known that the Chinese people are peace-loving .
wherever China is strongest , it does not constitute a threat to any other state , but on the contrary contributes constructively to the development of its neighbors and to regional and international stability and prosperity .
China hopes that Japan will reconsider its fears of its Asian neighbors and aspire to caution in security and military policies .
Japan must keep to the path of peace and contribute to regional peace and development .
it should be noted that Japan seems to follow the United States in security policy .
it is possible that Japan may change its defense priorities to countering terrorism following the September 11th attacks , and strengthen its defense capacities against what it calls " the danger of Democratic Korea " .
through its un@@ bel@@ i@@ ev@@ ably enthusiastic attitude towards the missile defense system in cooperation with the United States , its real aims are revealed .
it is not at all satisfactory that this missile system is designed only for the aforementioned targets .

Vienna December 14th / Xinhua / The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency , Mohamed El Baradei , has nothing to hide , according to the Austrian newspaper " Die Presse " which quoted El Baradei ' s spokesman on Tuesday , responding to reports that the United States was spying on El Baradei .
mark Gwozdecky , El Baradei ' s spokesman , said " we work on the assumption that one or more entities are ea@@ v@@ es@@ dropping on our activities " , adding that the Agency worked on behalf of all of its members and had nothing to hide .

Chinese Scientists discover Din@@ os@@ a@@ ur@@ -@@ E@@ ating m@@ am@@ m@@ al
Beijing January 13th / Xinhua / A report published today ( Thursday ) stated Chinese scientists have discovered a f@@ os@@ s@@ ili@@ zed din@@ os@@ a@@ ur@@ -@@ eating m@@ am@@ m@@ al in Liaoning Province , Northeast China .
the discovery , by Hu Ya@@ oming , Wang Yuan@@ qing and Li Chu@@ an@@ k@@ ui , all from the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Pal@@ e@@ on@@ t@@ ology and Pal@@ e@@ o@@ an@@ th@@ ro@@ pol@@ o@@ g@@ y , and Meng Jin from the Museum of Nature in New York , was published in a paper in the British journal Nature .
the f@@ os@@ s@@ ili@@ zed m@@ am@@ m@@ al lived during the Mes@@ o@@ z@@ o@@ ic era .
the discovery revealed that some l@@ arg@@ e-@@ size mammals that lived in that era may have been car@@ ni@@ v@@ or@@ ous , and brave enough to compete with dinosaurs for food and living space .
Li said that the und@@ ig@@ est@@ ed bones , including teeth and limbs , of a small dinosaur had been discovered in its stomach .
Li added that the un@@ broken jo@@ in@@ ts meant that the m@@ am@@ m@@ al tore up and swallowed the prey , without biting or ch@@ ew@@ ing .
he stated that prior to the latest discovery , most scientists had assumed that mammals in the Mes@@ o@@ z@@ o@@ ic era were fairly small and no@@ c@@ tur@@ n@@ al .
they were supposed to have eaten insects and not dared to come near dinosaurs .
Li said that the new discoveries challenge the long-held view , and proved that some primitive mammals were larger than middle-@@ sized dinosaurs .
scientists had previously believed that they ate small animals and walked around in daylight .
based on this analysis , the dinosaur which had been eaten was a third of the size of the m@@ am@@ m@@ al .
Russia V@@ ie@@ ws Final Peace Agreement with Japan as Long Ter@@ m Hope
Moscow January 13th / Xinhua / The Russian Foreign Minister said today ( Thursday ) that a peace agreement with Japan to officially end the enmity between the two countries , dating back to the Second World War , is a long term hope .
Interfax news agency quoted Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Alexeyev as saying " This work is continuing and will continue .
it is complicated and may take a long time " .
Alexeyev ' s comment came on the eve of the visit of Japanese Foreign Minister Nobutaka Machimura to Moscow which is expected to pave the way for Russian President Vladimir Putin ' s scheduled trip to Japan later this year .
Russia and Japan have still to sign a peace treaty to formally end wartime hostilities due to the continuing dispute over four islands to the north of Japan annexed by the Soviet Union in the closing days of the Second World War .
Russia recently offered to return to Japan two of the islands - known as the southern Kur@@ iles in Russia and the Northern Territories in Japan - after the conclusion of a peace treaty , citing a joint declaration signed in 1956 by the Soviet Union and Japan .
Japan has demanded the return of all four islands - which stretch from northern Japan to the tip of Russia ' s Kamchatka peninsula in the Far East - saying it is a prerequisite for signing the peace treaty .
it is expected that during Machimura ' s visit to Moscow , both sides will discuss the half-@@ c@@ ent@@ u@@ ry@@ -@@ old territorial dispute , preparations for Putin ' s tour of Japan and bilateral economic cooperation , according to Itar-Tass news agency reports .
it is expected that other issues including the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea and Iraq will also be discussed .
