Erdogan Con@@ firms That Turkey Will Re@@ j@@ ect Any Pres@@ su@@ res To En@@ courage It To Rec@@ o@@ gn@@ ize Cyprus
Ankara , 12 / 1 ( AFP ) - The Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan declared today , Wednesday , that Ankara will reject any pressures that the European Union may apply on it to encourage to recognize Cyprus . this comes two weeks before a summit of the heads of countries and governments of the European Union , who will decide on whether or not to start negotiations on joining with Ankara .
Erdogan told the NTV television station that " It is not possible for the European Union to talk to us by imposing new conditions on us regarding Cyprus .
we shall discuss this dossier during the negotiations on joining . "
and he added , " Let me be clear . Turkey ' s arm should not be twisted ; this is something we cannot accept . "
it is expected that the European Parliament will recommend on December 14 to the heads of state and government of the Union to approve the start of negotiations on joining with Ankara , but with specific conditions .
Greece considers that recognition by Ankara of Cyprus , which has also become a member of the European Union , is " an obvious condition " for the European Union to give the green light to start negotiations on joining with Ankara .
Turkey continues to refuse to recognize the Republic of Cyprus which became a member of the European Union last May 1st , but it is the only country in the world to have recognized the " Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus " which declared its independence in the north of the island .
Erdogan similarly rejected the possibility of starting negotiations for the establishment of a special partnership between Turkey and the European Union as an alternative to the negotiations on joining .
Erdogan said on this matter " this proposal , which we cannot accept , is incompatible with a serious organization like the European Union . "
adding " We wish to start negotiations during the first six months of 2005 or , if this does not work out , during the second part of the year ( .. ) but we cannot set the starting date of negotiations in 2006 . "

Bogota , 12 / 4 ( AFP ) - A reporter for Agence France Presse has reported that the boss of the Cali Car@@ tel ( southwest ) , Gilberto Rodriguez O@@ re@@ ju@@ ela , one of the most notorious drug traffickers in the world , was handed over Friday evening to the United States .
O@@ re@@ ju@@ ela , who is 64 years old and has been under arrest since 1995 , was transferred from La Pic@@ o@@ ta Prison and taken in an armored vehicle to a military base located near Bogota International Airport where he was handed over to officials of the American Drug Enforcement Agency .
the transfer operation was conducted in a car convoy under the protection of 120 policemen and soldiers while a police helicopter hovered over the area .
in a statement to Agence France Presse , Colonel Oscar Nar@@ anj@@ o , who is in charge of the extradition operation , said " We worked in coordination with American Drug Enforcement teams and handed them Rodriguez at the airport , and they transported him in a plane flying straight to the United States . "
O@@ re@@ ju@@ ela appeared calm as he was being led to the American plane that was to carry him to Miami in Florida .
the authorities reported that he was allowed to contact members of his family by phone from the armored car he was in .
he then underwent a medical examination by a police physician .
the Colombian President Alvaro Uribe had authorized the extradition operation on November 8 .
the decree , which was signed by the President and the Minister of the Interior and Justice , Sab@@ as P@@ ret@@ el@@ t , stated that Colombia agreed to the extradition of Rodriguez O@@ re@@ ju@@ ela on the basis of charges of " exporting drugs to the United States , possessing and distributing cocaine , and money-laundering through an international network of fictitious institutions . "
the Americans had submitted in December two requests for extraditing Rodriguez , also known as " the Ch@@ ess Player , " and his brother .
courts in Florida and New York charge the two brothers with exporting large quantities of cocaine to the United States between 1990 and July 2002 , laundering hundreds of millions of dollars and obstructing American justice .
in Florida , the Drug Enforcement Agency refused to comment on Colombia ' s decision .

"
he added that " more than thirty " were killed by his men ' s bullets at a checkpoint in Baghdad in the spring of 2003 .
he explained that soldiers at the time , out of fear of suicide operations , were opening fire on any car that did not stop at the checkpoint after a hand gesture or a warning shot .
he indicated that four cars thus came under heavy fire , but when the soldiers searched those inside the car they did not find any evidence proving that the car was transporting anyone but poor innocent people .
he also recalled that he saw soldiers killing four isolated demonstrators , and they also killed more people the next day during a surveillance operation in the Iraqi capital .
Jimmy Mas@@ sey wondered , " When you do n 't know who the enemy is , what do you do ? , " and after he suffered a nervous breakdown and displayed symptoms of psychological fatigue , he was dismissed from military service 12 years after joining the army .
Hin@@ s@@ man , who was with the 82nd Airborne Division and served in Afghanistan , said that he realized after his en@@ li@@ st@@ ment in 2001 that he is incapable of killing a human being .

Mahmoud Abbas : the Wall And The Settlements W@@ o n 't Provide Security To Israel
Tulkarm ( West Bank ) 12-@@ 29 ( AFP ) - The Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization Mahmoud Abbas said today , Wednesday , that the separation wall and Jewish settlements in the West Bank will not provide security to Israel .
Abbas , who was addressing a popular gathering in his campaign for the Palestinian presidency elections in Tulkarm in the northern West Bank , added " we say to our neighbors ( the Israelis ) that no matter what the number of settlements and walls and barriers that they erect , they will not provide security or peace " to you .
the gathering took place in a soccer field 500 meters away from the separation wall that the Hebrew State is building in the area .
the International Court of Justice in The Hague issued an opinion last July that the wall which Israel is building in the West Bank is illegal and demanded a halt to its construction and the removal of what has been completed of it .
Israel describes the wall as a " security fence " while the Palestinians describe it as a " racist separation wall " that annexes a large segment of the territories of the West Bank to Israel .
Abbas emphasized in his address the points of his political program , including a fair resolution to the case of the Palestinian refugees , the release of prisoners in Israeli jails , and the establishment of an independent Palestinian State with Jerusalem as its capital .
Abbas had earlier visited the Tulkarm refugee camp where he met a number of relatives of the martyrs and activists in the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades that is affiliated with the Fatah Movement and which he represents in the elections .
Abbas ( 69 years old ) was warmly welcomed in the camp and he was carried on the shoulders by the crowd .
Abbas is considered the candidate with the best chance to win against six opponents the presidential elections scheduled for this coming January 9 to succeed Yasser Arafat at the helm of the Palestinian Authority .

they had fled to a villa in the second district and it was n 't long before the security forces attacked them and killed them all , according to the same source .
the Al-@@ Arab@@ iyah satellite channel had reported that Saudi security forces killed seven individuals suspected of participation in the two attacks with booby-trapped cars in Riyadh that targeted the Interior Ministry and a Special Security Forces camp .

Riyadh was rocked tonight by two car bomb attacks .
the first car attempted to break into the main entrance of the Interior Ministry in the center of Riyadh , and then it exploded .
a second car bomb exploded shortly after at the entrance of a camp of Special Security Forces that it tried to break into .
Saudi security forces have been hunting down Islamic extremists who are responsible for a number of attacks that have in part targeted foreign interests or foreign nationals .

Riyadh 12-@@ 30 ( AFP ) - A Saudi security source declared today , Thursday , to Agence France Presse that a Yemeni , considered to be close to the leader of the Al-Qaeda organization Usama Bin Laden and the current leader of the Al-Qaeda organization in Saudi Arabia , is one of the seven persons who were killed yesterday , Wednesday , evening in a clash with security forces in Riyadh .

more Than 50 Thousand Dem@@ on@@ st@@ r@@ at@@ ors In Addis Ababa Against Meles Zenawi ' s Peace Plan With Eritrea
Addis Ababa 1-2 ( AFP ) - More than 50 thousand people demonstrated today , Sunday , in Addis Ababa in a protest over the peace plan proposed by the Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi to settle border disputes with Eritrea as reported by a correspondent of Agence France Presse .
this demonstration was organized by the opposition parties that charge Meles Zenawi with abandoning the country ' s territories .
according to the police , the demonstration , which comes before the important general elections scheduled for next May , gathered between 50 and 60 thousand demonstrators while the organizers estimated the number of participants at about one hundred thousand .
Ethiopia and Eritrea had fought a war over the borders from 1998 to 2000 .
and after a peace agreement was signed in 2000 in Algeria , an independent commission determined the new borders between the two countries , giving Eritrea the disputed town of Bad@@ me .
however , Ethiopia rejected this decision in September 2003 and suspended all del@@ ine@@ ation operations .
at the end of November , the Ethiopian Prime Minister proposed a peace plan in which he approved the " principle " of del@@ ine@@ ation as proposed by the commission but with some " amendments . "
this led Asmara to accuse Addis Ababa of wanting to gain time and demand that del@@ ine@@ ation operations begin on the ground .
Be@@ y@@ an@@ e Petros , Vice-President of the United Ethiopian Democratic Forces ( opposition ) , said " we call on public opinion to put pressure on the government until it withdraws its peace initiative which is in conflict with the interests of the people and the nation . "
he added " there is no reason to accept this new initiative that is based on excessive giving .
we have no reason to give one inch of our land to Eritrea . "
another opposition official by the name of Ge@@ br@@ o Ast@@ ati said " I ask the Ethiopian people to vote against the Prime Minister and demand a new government that will make a new peace initiative . "
Eritrea had been an Ethiopian province before it gained its independence in 1993 .
Islamic Presidential Can@@ di@@ date : the Palestinian Leadership Has Fa@@ il@@ ed To Def@@ end The Palestinian Cause
Ramallah 1-3 ( AFP ) - One of the candidates for the position of President of the Palestinian Authority accused the Palestinian leadership of " failing " to defend the " just " Palestinian cause over the past long years .
the independent Islamic candidate Sayyed Hussein Barakeh ( 48 years old ) told Agence France Presse " there was some kind of failure in presenting our demands " and he added " we were the biggest failure of a lawyer for the most win@@ n@@ able case , and the lawyer during those years was the Palestinian leadership . "
Barakeh uncovered the facts about a meeting he held with the spiritual leader of Hamas movement , Sheikh Ahmad Yassin , ten days before he was assassinated , saying that Sheikh Yassin " completely agreed that Hamas would participate in political life and management of the Palestinian society . "
he said " for the sake of honesty and truth , Sheikh Yassin was absolutely convinced of political participation in the Palestinian society . "
Israeli helicopters had fired three rockets on Sheikh Ahmad Yassin last March tw@@ ent@@ y-@@ second upon his return from the mosque after performing dawn prayers , which led to his immediate death and the death of seven other individuals with him .
prior to the announcement of his participation in the elections , Barakeh had worked as General Director of the Palestinian Ministry of Youth and Sports and he had an organizational relationship with the Islamic Jihad Movement , but he had asserted that his relationship with that movement was severed in the middle of 1991 .
he said that in the aftermath of the death of President Yasser Arafat he dispatched a memorandum to the Hamas and the Islamic Jihad Mov@@ ements in which he proposed his idea about the importance of participation in the upcoming presidential elections .
he said " the answer to my memorandum was that Hamas and Islamic Jihad announced that they will not participate in the elections , neither by running nor voting , and that they will support no one . "
after that , Barakeh decided to run himself for the presidential elections , indicating that he has achieved victory in the elections before running , through what he described as " relative support to him among the Palestinians . "
he also expected that he would have a role in the future at the level of the Islamic Movement across the Palestinian territories , even if he was not lucky enough to win in the elections .

Oxfam : need To A@@ void P@@ ast mistakes In The Area Of International Aid
London 1-@@ 4 ( AFP ) - The international humanitarian organization " Oxfam " today , Tuesday , called for avoiding the repeat of past mistakes in the area of humanitarian aid , two days before the Jakarta meeting dedicated to the victims of the tsunami that took place December 26 .
the Director of the organization Barbara St@@ oc@@ king said in a letter addressed to the countries participating in the conference " we have to behave in such a way as not to repeat the mistakes that were made during previous humanitarian crises in Afghanistan , Liberia and elsewhere , where donors were unable to provide aid quickly enough , and they did so at the expense of other disasters . "
she added " rich countries must join the outpouring of generosity among comp@@ assi@@ on@@ ate people and take a number of important measures that will allow the reconstruction of the lives of millions of people whose lives have been destroyed by this catastrophe . "
Oxfam welcomed the pledges of two billion dollars of international aid , but pointed that this is only the beginning of a long reconstruction operation in the region .
the organization recommended that the pledges be translated into reality , reminding that the United Nations received pledges of 3@@ 2.6 million dollars following the earthquake that struck the Iranian city of Bam .
but that only 17.7 millions were actually given .
the letter stressed the need for the aid to be in the form of grants not loans , not be tied to the interests of the donor country , and be given over a five-year period .
it also mentioned that aid should be new donations that are not diverted from assistance funds for the two crises of Darfur in Sudan and in the Congo .
as for the debts owed by the countries afflicted by the earthquake and the tsunami , Oxfam called for a rapid review of the debts provided that a working team be set up to think of ways of canceling the debts of those countries .
in the area of trade , the organization requested that the United States and Europe open their markets to textiles imported from Sri Lanka and the Maldives Islands , which are two countries whose economies heavily depend on the export of clothes , in addition to tourism .

Prince Nayef said in statements reported by the Tunisian News Agency that " it is true that the operations that took place are worrisome and disturbing , and that their tools are the sons of the nation , but matters are under control . "
he added that he has told the Tunisian President who chairs the current session of the Arab summit that " these matters did not affect the daily life of the Saudi citizen and resident , and even less the business of the State . people live a normal life , and entering and leaving the Kingdom proceed in a natural movement , and economic activity is at an optimal level , and economic growth is very good and is perhaps the best in the world .

signing In Nairobi Of Final Peace Agreement For Southern Sudan
Nairobi 1-@@ 9 ( AFP ) - The Sudanese Vice-President Ali U@@ th@@ man Taha and the leader of the Sudan People ' s Liberation Army , the southern rebellion movement , signed today , Sunday , in Nairobi the final peace agreement in the south of Sudan , according to reports by Agence France Presse journalists .
Taha and Garang signed the agreement in the presence of a number of African Heads of State and Governments and a number of representatives of the international community , including the American Secretary of State Colin Powell .
the ceremony was conducted in " Ny@@ ayo , " one of Nairobi ' s two large stadiums near the city center .
each of the two Presidents , Kenyan Mwai Kibaki and Ugandan Yoweri Museveni , also signed the agreement as " witnesses " according to the official protocol of the ceremony .
Museveni is the President of the regional Inter-Governmental Authority on Development ( IGAD ) , which is a group of seven countries that organized the mediation in this peace operation .
Powell also signed this agreement along with other witnesses , among whom was the Norwegian Minister of International Cooperation Hil@@ da Johnson .
this agreement puts an end to 21 years of civil war , the longest continuing conflict in the African continent .
this war broke out in 1983 when " The Sudan People ' s Liberation Army , " emerging from the Sudanese south where the majority of the inhabitants are Christians and animists , rebelled against the Arab Muslim north .
the conflict resulted in the death of at least 5.1 million people and the displacement of about four million people .
however , this agreement does not mean that peace now prevails in Sudan , where another conflict broke out in February 2003 in the Darfur district ( west ) and resulted in the death of more than seventy thousand people and the displacement of about 6.1 million people .
still , peace in the south constitutes an important incentive for progress in the negotiations between the government and the rebel movements in Darfur .

European Commission Op@@ ens D@@ is@@ c@@ us@@ si@@ ons On European Policy Reg@@ ar@@ ding Economic Immigration
Strasbourg 1-@@ 11 ( AFP ) - The European Commission launched today , Tuesday , a consultative process on the feasibility of drawing up a new policy on economic immigration to the European Union with the objective of making up for the expected workforce deficit resulting from the aging of European society .
these consultations will take place through a " green book " in which each of the member countries , association partners and non-governmental organizations will submit their proposals and views before April 15 , so that the Commission can propose a program of action before the end of the year .
the Commission stated that between " 2010 and 2030 , and if the current rate of immigration persists , the reduction in the size of the workforce in the 25 countries of the Union will lead to a reduction in the number of workers by 20 million workers . "
it added that " a higher rate of immigration may become increasingly necessary to meet the needs of the European market . "
but the Commission stressed that these measures will never specify the number of workers who will be permitted to enter each country , as this issue is the prerogative of the national administrations according to the European Constitution project .
however , the Commission said that the decision to allow foreigners to enter one country of the Union will impact the other countries of the Union because of the freedom of movement inside the " Schengen " zone and because of the right to benefit from services in other countries , etc .
the Commission also suggested putting in place unified standards for allowing immigration , with the greatest possible degree of consistency in agreement with the will of member countries .
the European Commissioner for Justice , Freedom and Security Franco Fr@@ at@@ ini is aware " that member countries , the European Parliament , the unions , companies and numerous parties concerned have differing opinions on this matter . "
whereas Italy and Spain support the idea of opening the door to greater immigration , Germany , which suffers from a high unemployment rate , opposes it .
the European Commission had submitted a proposal memorandum to unify the conditions of entry and residency in the European Union for this type of legal immigrants , but did not succeed .

Caruana believed that British and Spanish authorities have realized that their attempt to treat the question of sovereignty over Gibraltar in a bilateral process " is destined to fail because that is a violation of the dignity of the inhabitants of Gibraltar . "
in November 2002 , 97.@@ 98 % of the 20 thousand and 500 voters in Gibraltar declared in a referendum that they wanted to remain British . "
and on December 17 , Spain , Britain and Gibraltar announced the creation of a " Di@@ alo@@ g Forum on Gibraltar , " in which Madrid agreed for the first time that the government of Gibraltar enjoy decision-making authority like London and Madrid .

he said that this demand " is an issue that Spain will not relinquish .
and this is a basic principle . "
the British colony of Gibraltar , which is a six square kilometers area in southern Spain , is located at the entrance of the strait connecting the Atlantic Ocean with the Mediterranean Sea .

Iran Den@@ ies Information About Presence of American Commando Groups In Iran
Tehran 1-@@ 19 ( AFP ) - A senior Iranian official denied information in the press reporting the infiltration of groups of American commandos inside Iran in order to identify the location of nuclear sites that could be targeted with air strikes , as reported by Iranian newspapers today , Wednesday .
the spokesman for the Supreme National Security Council Ali Agha Mohammadi said " no American commando groups are able to enter Iran so easily to spy and it would be naive to accept such an idea . "
he added " We know our borders . "
Mohammadi also criticized the information reported by the American " New Yorker " magazine , considering it as part of the " psychological campaign " against the Islamic Republic .
the " New Yorker " wrote in its latest issue that groups of American commandos have been conducting secret reconnaissance missions inside Iran since the summer of 2004 in search of possible nuclear and chemical targets .
and in spite of the denial of this information by the American Department of Defense ( The Pentagon ) , its publication resulted in an increase in predictions about possible American military operations in order to stop Iranian nuclear activities .
the tone of these predictions rose when the American President George Bush declared Monday in an interview with the " NBC " American television network that he does not exclude a military operation against Iran .
Bush said " I hope we can solve this matter diplomatically , but I w@@ o n 't ever exclude any option . "
Ali Agha Mohammadi said that the New Yorker information " is not worth pa@@ using for . "
he reiterated the position that the Iranian nuclear program is a peaceful one and that Iran does not seek to obtain an atomic bomb , as asserted by the United States .
he added " we do not possess nuclear weapons and the International Atomic Energy Agency has inspected Iranian installations . "
the former Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani , who remains an influential figure in the Iranian regime , warned the United States on Tuesday against any military operation against Iran .
the Iranian News Agency quoted Rafsanjani as saying that " our external enemies ' threat does not scare us , and they know well that Iran , the historic Islamic State with its ancient civilization , is not a place for ad@@ v@@ ent@@ u@@ res . "

General Wil@@ hel@@ ms@@ en declared at a press conference today , Wednesday , that the success of the mission , which he leads in the Nuba Mountains ( one of three regions en@@ comp@@ ass@@ ed by the peace agreement signed on January 9 in Nairobi between Khartoum and the southern rebels ) , is attributed to the good cooperation between veteran fighters .
he stated that the mechanism that is in effect in the Nuba Mountains can be applied by other parties in Sudan after the evaluation of the security conditions in each region .
he added that there has been no confrontation between armed forces in the Nuba Mountains since the start of the implementation of the armistice , clarifying that the lessons learned from that experience will be submitted to the United Nations in order to benefit from them in other regions .
General Wil@@ hel@@ ms@@ en mentioned that the success of the armistice has translated since 2002 in a doubling of the number of inhabitants in the region , which rose from 720 thousand people to a million and a half .
he said that life has almost resumed its natural cycle in spite of the mines that were laid during the war .
and on the fifth of January , the Sudanese News Agency reported that the United Nations has asked for a period of one hundred days to replace the Joint Military Commission in the Nuba Mountains .

British Deputy Prime Minister : Dalian S@@ uc@@ c@@ e@@ ed@@ ed In becoming A Modern Industrial City
Dalian December 3 / Xinhua / Dalian succeeded in transforming itself from an old industrial economy to a modern industrial city as mentioned here today , Friday , by the visiting British Deputy Prime Minister and First Secretary of State of Foreign Affairs John Prescott .
Prescott made this statement during his meeting with Wang Cheng Ming , Vice Mayor of Dalian , which is a city in the province of Liaoning famous for its cl@@ e@@ an@@ lin@@ ess and strength in the old industrial belt in the northeast of China .
the northeastern region of China , which includes the provinces of Liaoning , Jilin and He@@ il@@ on@@ jiang , is the largest and oldest industrial base in China .
this region began falling behind other regions in the nineties because of bl@@ o@@ ated companies owned by the state and the depletion of resources .
in 2003 , the central government proposed an agenda for the revitalization of the old industrial base and planned to invest more than 60 billion yuan / 7.2 billion American dollars / in the region .
Prescott said that many cities in the north of Britain , like the cities of the northeast of China , are trying to convert from co@@ al-@@ based or ir@@ on-@@ based economy to become modern industrial cities .
and Dalian offers a good example for that transformation and will lead the transformation in the region towards new industries .
Wang said that Dalian hopes to increase cooperation with Britain , particularly in maritime shipment businesses .
it is noted that Dalian has 71 British investment projects , most of which are in the areas of manufacturing , trade and service industry .
the value of contractual investments is estimated at 430 million American dollars and actual investments at 158 million American dollars .
experts : Chinese Economic Growth O@@ ff@@ ers An Opportunity , Not A Threat , To Latin American Countries
Beijing December 5 / Xinhua / Economic and trade relations between China and Latin American countries are progressing well since they are consistent with internationally-recognized norms .
as a result , Chinese economic growth will offer more opportunities and does not constitute a threat to the countries of Latin America .
this is what Song Xiaoping , Deputy Director of the Latin American Research Institute affiliated with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences , declared in a press interview conducted with him by a " Xinhua " correspondent on the occasion of an international forum that opened Friday in the Chinese capital Beijing .
Song said in the forum , which is entitled " The R@@ ise of China .. Opportunity and Challenges to Latin America and Asia , " that Chinese economic growth is akin to a locomotive dragging the world ' s economic development .
for the Latin American countries , China is a driving force that st@@ im@@ ul@@ ates the Latin American economic growth at present and in the future .
citing a report issued by the Economic Commission for Latin America , he said that the e@@ bu@@ ll@@ i@@ ent growth of the Chinese economy and the increase in Chinese imports from Latin America over the past years have stimulated a strong in@@ v@@ ig@@ or@@ ation of the Latin American economy , such that China has become the third largest importer and the fourth largest exporter to Latin America .
this expert added that the accelerating growth of the Chinese economy is laying a good foundation for the evolution of Chinese-@@ Latin American trade on one hand , and on the other hand Latin America has ex@@ ited its financial crisis that erupted in the late nineties , overcoming a period of economic stagnation .
all of this offers a favorable opportunity to develop economic and trade relations between the two sides , and one can expect these relations to experience encouraging progress over the next five to ten years .

Abkhazia had conducted a presidential ballot on October 3 when Bagapsh obtained 4@@ 3,3@@ 36 votes and Kha@@ d@@ zh@@ im@@ ba 30,@@ 815 votes .
but a conflict soon erupted about the result between the candidates competing in the elections , Kha@@ d@@ zh@@ im@@ ba who has Russia ' s support , and the leader of the opposition , Bagapsh .
Bagapsh , who insists on his victory in the elections , said that he will hold an inauguration ceremony as scheduled on Monday " in spite of the pressures that are exerted on him . "
Gen@@ ad@@ y Bok@@ ayev , Assistant to the Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkov , warned on Wednesday that in case any " unconstitutional measures are taken " Russia will close its borders with Abkhazia and will take necessary measures to prevent an increase in violence in the region .
Abkhazia had declared its independence from Georgia in the early nineties after the collapse of the Soviet Union .

Iraqi Justice Minister F@@ ears Ou@@ t@@ b@@ re@@ ak Of Civil War In Iraq
Baghdad December 5 / Xinhua / The Iraqi Justice Minister Malek Dou@@ han Al-@@ Hassan expressed his fear of an outbreak of civil war in case the transitional government insists on holding Iraqi elections as scheduled at the end of next January .
in statements to the American radio station / / S@@ awa / / on Sunday night , Malek Al-@@ Hassan expressed his support for the call by some Iraqi parties to postpone the elections until the security situation st@@ ab@@ ili@@ zes in Iraq , deeming the timing not appropriate for holding these elections .
al-Hassan indicated that the no@@ t@@ ables and sheikhs of the tribes of Mosul , Tikrit , Baquba and Ramadi have refused to participate in the elections and have called for boycotting them in case the transitional government rejects the demands of the people of these governorates for dividing Iraq into more than one electoral district and representing the governorates in the National Assembly on the basis of demographic proportions .
he said that although there is a popular Iraqi wish to form an elected government in order for foreign troops to evacuate Iraq , it remains impossible to hold elections under the current security conditions .
the Iraqi Justice Minister further said that it is not possible to guarantee security for the voter when he goes to cast his vote , and it is not possible to guarantee security for the candidate when he meets with his supporters to announce his electoral program .
a number of senior Sunni Muslim politicians had previously urged the government to postpone the elections for a period of six months to provide the authorities with the required time to secure the voting centers and convince the Sunni clergy to abandon their call for boycott of the elections .
however , the spokesman for Interim Prime Minister Iyad Allawi said that the government is sticking with the date of January 30 after receiving assurances from the Iraqi Electoral Commission that elections can be held even in the Sunni regions that were destroyed by the insurgency .
for his part , the American President George W. Bush emphasized on December 2 that Iraqi elections must take place on the th@@ ir@@ ti@@ e@@ th of January as scheduled , indicating that " the time has come for Iraqi citizens to go to the ballot boxes . "
the African Union Ex@@ presses Its Confidence In Annan
Addis Ababa December 6 / Xinhua / The Executive Council of the African Union expressed today , Monday , its deeply rooted confidence in the Secretary General of the United Nations Kofi Annan , who is currently under attack because of accusations that his son received commissions for seven years from a company that participated in the oil-for-food program between the United Nations and Iraq .
meeting in an emergency session , the Council said that the Secretary General of the United Nations has always expressed a great commitment to the ideals of the United Nations and a determination to change its stature in a world dominated by globalization .

it is expected that the Council will discuss in its session today , Tuesday , the issues pertaining to the budget of the Union .
an investigation was conducted with Ko@@ jo Annan , the Secretary General ' s son , on charges of corruption .
rumors of corruption surfaced in January when an Iraqi newspaper published a list of about 270 prominent personalities from at least 46 countries and said that they have received oil mon@@ ies from the Saddam ' s regime .
it was said that the list included Benon Sevan , a United Nations official who was the director of the program , but he has strongly denied this accusation .
subsequently , a committee in the American Congress accused the international organization of mis@@ managing the program and said that the organization allowed Saddam Hussein to obtain more than 10 billion dollars from oil revenues .
Annan conducted an internal investigation in February but canceled it in March in anticipation of a wider and independent investigation .
the oil-for-food program was initiated in December 1996 to allow Iraq to export what amounts to 6@@ 9.5 billion American dollars of oil .
the United Nations supervised Iraqi oil sales and the purchase by Iraq of humanitarian supplies , and the program was canceled in November of last year .

Gaza December 11 / Xinhua / Palestinian sources close to the Fatah Movement said today , Saturday , that the candidacy of Marwan Barghouti , the Secretary of the Movement in the West Bank , who is detained in Israeli jails , is illegal .
the sources , who requested anonymity , clarified that the candidacy of Barghouti , who is detained in Israel under a sentence of five life terms " violates one of the articles of the Palestinian National Authority ' s electoral law for presidential elections . "
they added that " the law o@@ bl@@ ig@@ ates anyone wishing to be a candidate for the Palestinian presidency to resign from any position he occupies and to present that resignation in writing to the General Elections Committee , especially for members of public agencies , judges and security personnel , and it also applies to members of the Palestinian Legislative Council . "
the sources clarified " that Hassan Kh@@ re@@ ish@@ eh , the Acting President of the Legislative Council , had to retract his decision to enter the presidential elections after he was notified by council members that he had to choose between maintaining his membership in the council and submitting his resignation to run for the elections as stipulated by Palestinian law .

commentary : strange Reference To " Chinese Threat " In Japanese Defense Program
Tokyo December 11 / Xinhua / The Japanese government revealed on Friday a ten-year defense program that describes China without any justification as a potential threat , besides the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea .
and while Democratic Korea has no diplomatic relations with Tokyo , China is a country with which Japan has signed a peace agreement and has very close economic relations .
and in spite of the diplomatic wording , the summary of the Japanese defense program states that China and Democratic Korea are the only two neighbors that pose a threat to it .
the document issued by the Japanese government on Friday says " that it is necessary to monitor the Chinese nuclear and ballistic missile programs , its modernization of its naval and air forces , and its attempts at expanding its naval activities . "
China and Japan normalized their relations 32 years ago .
in addition to the peace and friendship agreement that was signed six years later , the two countries agreed to upgrade their relations to a partnership relation in 1998 .
over the past three decades , trade between them increased by 130 fold and is scheduled to reach 150 billion American dollars this year .
China could become the largest trading partner for Japan in the very near future .
overall Japanese investments in China total 46 billion dollars .
the large integration of the economies of the two countries has given great importance to the long-term friendship and peace relations between Japan and China , not only for the two countries , but also with respect to peace and prosperity in East Asia and the world at large .
in this context , it is difficult to understand why Japan believes that China is a source of threat .
the Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Hosoda Hiroyuki tried to downplay the issue of the " Chinese threat . "
he told reporters on Friday that the new defense program did not mention China as a threat but as a country that deserves the attention of Japan in the area of security .
commentary : strange Reference To " Chinese Threat " In Japanese Defense Program / First And Last Ad@@ di@@ tion /
but his explanation did not even convince the Japanese media which said that this is the first time the Japanese defense program refers to a " Chinese threat , " even if indirectly .
the move of the Japanese government to put forth a " Chinese threat " is incompatible with the aspirations of the two peoples for permanent peace and friendship .
the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue commented that China has expressed " its grave dissatisfaction " about the Japanese move , saying " there is nothing to justify it and it is completely irresponsible . "
it is known that the Chinese people are peace-loving .
and that a strong China will not pose a threat to any other country , but on the contrary it will make a constructive contribution to the development of its neighbors and to regional and international stability and prosperity .
and China hopes that Japan takes into consideration the fears of its Asian neighbors and is careful with its security and military policies .
Japan must hold firm to the path of peace and contribute to regional peace and development .
it is worth mentioning that Japan appears to be following the United States with its security strategy .
and that it is possible that Japan may be changing its defense priority to fighting terrorism after the September 11 attacks and is strengthening its defense capabilities against what it calls " the danger of Democratic Korea . "
but its un@@ bel@@ i@@ ev@@ ably enthusiastic direction towards a missile defense system in cooperation with the United States reveals its real intentions .
and it is entirely un@@ convincing that this missile system is designed only for the above-mentioned purposes .

Vienna December 14 / Xinhua / The Head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed ElBaradei is not hiding anything , according to the Austrian newspaper / / Press / / on Tuesday , quoting ElBaradei ' s spokesman , who was replying to reports that the United States was spying on ElBaradei .

the f@@ os@@ s@@ ili@@ zed m@@ am@@ m@@ al lived in the Mes@@ o@@ z@@ o@@ ic era .
this discovery revealed that some large mammals living during that era could have been car@@ ni@@ v@@ or@@ ous and may have had enough courage to compete with the dinosaurs over food and shelter .
Li said that und@@ ig@@ est@@ ed bones , including teeth and limbs , of a small dinosaur were found in its stomach .

it was assumed that they ate insects and did not dare to get close to dinosaurs .
