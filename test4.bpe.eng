final Southern Sudan Peace Agreement signed In Nairobi
Nairobi 1-@@ 9 ( AFP ) - Sudan ' s Vice President Ali U@@ th@@ man Taha and the Chairman of the Sudan People ' s Liberation Army , the southern rebellion movement , signed today , Sunday , the final peace agreement in southern Sudan according to journalists of the Agence French Presse .
Taha and Garang signed the agreement in the presence of a number of African Presidents and Prime Ministers and a number of representatives of the international community among them the American Secretary of State Colin Powell .
the ceremony took place in " Ny@@ ayo , " one of Nairobi ' s two large stadiums near the center of the city .
the Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki and the Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni signed as " witnesses " on the agreement according to the official ceremony protocol .
Museveni is the President of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development ( IGAD ) , a consortium of seven countries that had mediated this peace process .
Powell also signed the agreement along with other witnesses , among them the Norwegian Minister of International Development Hil@@ de Johnson .
this agreement brings to an end a 21-year civil war , the longest ongoing conflict in the African continent .
this war broke out in 1983 when the " Sudan People ' s Liberation Army , " which came out of southern Sudan , dominated by Christianity and African Traditional religions , rebelled against the Arab Muslim north .
the conflict resulted in the killing of at least 5.1 million people and the displacement of about four million people .
but this agreement does not mean that peace prevails over all of Sudan . another conflict broke out in the end of February 2003 in the Darfur province ( West ) and it resulted in killing more than seventy thousand people and the displacement of about 6.1 million .
however , peace in the south gives a significant push to the progress of negotiations between the government and the rebel movements in Darfur .

European Commission Op@@ ens D@@ is@@ c@@ us@@ si@@ ons On European Economic Immigration Policy
Strasbourg 1-@@ 11 ( AFP ) - The European Commission launched today , Tuesday , a consultative operation about the feasibility of implementing a new policy for economic immigration to the European Union aimed at covering the shortage in workforce that is expected as a result of the aging of the European society .
those consultations will take place through " a green book " in which all member countries , social partners and non-governmental organizations will write their suggestions and visions before April 15 so that the Commission can recommend a work plan before the end of the year .
the Commission confirmed that " if immigration continues at the current rate , between 2010 and 2030 the decrease in workforce in the 25 Union countries would lead to the number of workers dropping by 20 million . "
it added that " a higher immigration ratio may become even more important to cover the needs of the European market . "
the Commission , however , stressed that these measures would never limit the number of workers allowed to enter each country because that was under the jurisdiction of national administrations according to the European Constitution project .
but the Commission said that the decision to allow foreigners to enter a country of the Union would impact the other Union countries because of the freedom of movement inside the " Schengen " area and because of the right to use the services of the other countries , etc ...
the Commission recommended setting uniform standards for allowing immigration with the highest level possible of harmony and agreement according to the will of the member countries .
the European Union Commissioner responsible for Justice , Freedom and Security Franco Fr@@ at@@ ini recognizes " that the member countries , the European Parliament , the labor unions , the companies and other relevant entities all have their different views on this issue . "
if Italy and Spain support opening the door to more immigration , Germany will suffer from a high unemployment rate , a matter it opposes .
the European Commission had presented a recommendation to unify the European Union entry and residency requirements for this kind of legal immigrants but it had failed .

Iran Den@@ ies Information About Presence Of American Com@@ man@@ dos In Iran
Tehran 1-@@ 19 ( AFP ) - A senior Iranian official has dismissed media reports that groups of American commandos have infiltrated into Iran to identify location of nuclear sites for possible air strikes , as Iranian press reported today , Wednesday .
" American commando groups can not enter Iran so easily to spy . it is naive to accept such an idea , " said Ali Agha Mohammadi , a spokesperson for the Supreme National Security Council .
" we know our borders , " he added .
Mohammadi criticized reports in the American magazine " The New Yorker " dismissing them as part of the " psychological campaign " against the Islamic Republic .
the " New Yorker " wrote in its latest issue that American commando groups had been carrying out surveillance missions in Iran since the summer of 2004 to seek out potential nuclear and chemical targets .
in spite of the denial by the American Department of Defense ( the Pentagon ) , publishing this information has raised predictions of potential American military operations to stop Iran ' s nuclear activities .
the intensity of those predictions increased when the American President George Bush said Monday in an interview with the " NBC " American television network that he did not rule out a military operation against Iran .
Bush said , " I hope that we can solve this problem in a diplomatic way , but I will not rule out any option . "
Ali Agha Mohammadi said that the New Yorker information " is not worth stopping for . "
he repeated that the Iranian nuclear program was peaceful and that Iran was not seeking to obtain an atomic bomb , as the United States insisted .
he added , " we do not possess nuclear weapons and the International Atomic Energy Agency has inspected the Iranian facilities . "
the former Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani , who is still influential in the Iranian establishment , cautioned Tuesday the United States against any military operation against Iran .
the Iranian News Agency quoted Rafsanjani saying that " we are not afraid of our foreign enemies ' threats and they know that as an old Islamic country rich of its ancient history Iran is not the place for ad@@ v@@ ent@@ u@@ res . "

General Wil@@ hel@@ ms@@ en announced during a press conference today , Wednesday , that the success of the operation he is in charge of in the Nuba Mountains ( one of three regions covered by the peace agreement that was signed in Nairobi on January 9 between Khartoum and the southern rebels ) is attributed to the good cooperation between the veteran fighters .

he added that no confrontation between the armed forces in the Nuba Mountains had taken place since the implementation of the ceasefire , explaining that the lessons learned from this experience would be submitted to the United Nations to be used in other areas .
General Wil@@ hel@@ ms@@ en stated that the success of the ceasefire since 2002 has translated in the doubling of the number of inhabitants in the area which went up from 720 thousand people to a million and a half .
he said that life was almost back to normal in spite of the mines that were laid during the war .
the Sudanese News Agency reported on the fifth of January that the United Nations has asked for a period of one hundred days to replace the Joint Military Committee in the Nuba Mountains .

Dalian , December 3 / Xinhua / Dalian has succeeded in tr@@ an@@ si@@ tion@@ ing from an old industrial economy to a modern industrial city , said visiting British Deputy Prime Minister and First Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs John Prescott here today , Friday .
Prescott made this statement during his meeting with Wang Cheng Ming , Vice Mayor of Dalian , a city in the Liaoning province known for its cl@@ e@@ an@@ lin@@ ess and strength in the old industrial belt of northeast China .
northeast China , comprised of Liaoning , Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces , is considered to be China ' s biggest and oldest industrial base .
this area began to lag behind other areas in the nineties due to bl@@ o@@ ated state-owned companies and the depletion of resources .
in 2003 , the central government brought forward an agenda to revitalize the old industrial base and planned to invest more than 60 billion yuan ( 7.2 billion US dollars ) in the area .
Prescott said that , like cities in northeast China , many cities in northern Britain are trying to shift from coal or steel based economy to become modern industrial cities .
Dalian is a good example of that transition and will lead the transition of the whole area into new industries .
Wang said Dalian is hoping for more cooperation with Britain , especially in the area of maritime shipping .
there are 71 British investment projects in Dalian , most of which are in the fields of manufacturing , trade and service industry .
contractual investments are estimated at 430 million US dollars and actual investments at 158 million US dollars .

Song said in this symposium titled " The Em@@ er@@ g@@ ence of China ... Opportunities and Challenges for Latin America and Asia " that the Chinese economic growth is like a locomotive engine that is pulling the world ' s economic growth .
for Latin American countries , China is a driving force that st@@ im@@ ul@@ ates the growth of the Latin American economy now and in the future .
he quoted a report by the Latin American Economic Commission saying that the rapid growth of the Chinese economy and the increase in Chinese imports from Latin America in the recent years strongly stimulated the revival of the Latin American economy , which made China the third largest importer and fourth largest exporter to Latin America .
this expert added that the accelerated Chinese economic growth creates on one hand a good foundation for the Chinese-@@ Latin American trade development and on the other hand Latin America got out of the financial crisis of the late nineties thus overcoming the phase of economic stagnation .
all of this provides an great opportunity to develop the economic and trade relations between the two sides . it is expected that these relations will witness an encouraging progress in the next five to ten years .

Iraq Justice Minister F@@ ears breakout Of Civil War In Iraq
Baghdad , December 5 / Xinhua / Iraqi Justice Minister Malek Dou@@ han Al-@@ Hassan expressed his fear that a civil war would break out if the provisional government insisted on conducting the Iraqi elections as scheduled at the end of next January .
Malek Al-@@ Hassan expressed in a statement to the American S@@ awa radio Sunday night his support for the call by some Iraqi parties to postpone the elections until the security situation in Iraq is stable , saying that the time is not appropriate for carrying out those elections .
al-Hassan said that the prominent people and tribal leaders of Mosul , Tikrit , Baquba and Ramadi had refused to participate in the elections and called for its boycott in case the provisional government rejected the demands of the people of those provinces to divide Iraq into more than one electoral district and to represent the provinces in the National Assembly according to population ratios .
he said that in spite of the Iraqi popular desire to form an elected government so that the foreign forces leave Iraq , it is impossible to conduct elections under the current security conditions .
the Iraqi Justice Minister explained that it is not possible to guarantee the safety of voters when they go to vote and it is not possible to guarantee the safety of the candidate when he meets with his supporters to promote his election program .
a number of high level Sunni Muslim politicians had earlier urged the government to postpone the elections for six months to give the authorities enough time to secure voting centers and to convince Sunni religious leaders to abandon their call for the boycotting of the elections .
but the spokesperson for the Interim Prime Minister Iyad Allawi said that the government is committed to the January 30 date after receiving assurances from the Iraqi Electoral Commission that it is possible to conduct elections even in the Sunni areas destroyed by the insurgency .
for his part , the American President George W Bush stressed on December 2 that the Iraqi elections should be conducted as scheduled on the th@@ ir@@ ti@@ e@@ th of January saying that " time has come for the Iraqi people to go to the voting boxes . "
African Union Ex@@ presses Confidence In Annan
Addis Ababa , December 6 / Xinhua / The African Union Executive Council today , Monday , expressed its un@@ shaken confidence in the United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan , who is currently under fire because his son is accused of receiving commissions for seven years from a company participating in the United Nations oil-for-food program for Iraq .

Annan launched an internal investigation in February but canceled it in March in preparation for a broader and more independent investigation .
the oil-for-food program started in December 1996 to allow Iraq to export oil worth 6@@ 9.5 billion US dollars .
the United Nations oversaw Iraq ' s oil sales and its purchases of humanitarian supplies . the program was canceled in November of last year .

sources : illegal To N@@ om@@ in@@ ate Marwan Barghouti To Presidential Elections
Gaza December 11 / Xinhua / Palestinian sources close to the Fatah Movement said today , Saturday , that nominating the Secretary of the Movement in the West Bank Marwan Bar@@ gh@@ ou@@ thi , who is detained in Israeli jails is illegal .
the sources , who wished to remain anonymous , explained that the candidacy of Barghouti , who is imprisoned in Israel on 5 life sentences " violates an article in the presidential electoral laws of the Palestinian National Authority . "
they added , " the law demands that any person running for the presidential elections resign any position he holds and present the resignation in written format to the General Elections Committee . this is especially the case for members of public authorities , judges and security personnel . the same applies for members of the Palestinian Legislative Council . "
the sources noted , " Hassan Kh@@ re@@ ish@@ eh , acting speaker of the Legislative Council , had to withdraw his decision to run for the presidential elections after he was notified by council members that he had to choose between staying a member of the council and submitting his resignation according to Palestinian law . "
the sources confirmed " the same applies to Barghouti , who announced his candidacy without resigning from the Legislative Council , which is a legal violation that would prevent him from moving forward with his candidacy for these elections . "
the sources said that the tenth article dealing with candidacy for the President ' s post states that " the rulings of article / 14 / of this law apply to all candidates for presidency except for the sitting President of the Palestinian National Authority . "

commentary : strange H@@ int Of " Chinese Threat " In Japan ' s Defense Program
Tokyo December 11 / Xinhua / The Japanese government unveiled a ten-year defense program on Friday which g@@ rou@@ n@@ d@@ l@@ ess@@ ly describes China as a potential threat alongside the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea .
while Democratic Korea has no diplomatic relations with Tokyo , China is a country with which Japan has signed a peace treaty and maintains very close economic ties .
although its wording was diplomatic , the outline of Japan ' s defense program mentions China and the Democratic Korea as the only neighbors that pose a threat to it .
" it is necessary to watch China ' s nuclear and ballistic missile programs , the modernization of its navy and air forces and its attempts to expand marine activities , " said the document released by the Japanese government on Friday .
China and Japan normalized their relations 32 years ago .
in addition to the treaty of peace and friendship signed six years later , the two countries agreed to upgrade their relations to a partnership in 1998 .
in the past three decades , trade has increased by more than 130 times and is expected to reach 150 billion US dollars this year .
China might become Japan ' s biggest trading partner in the very near future .
Japan ' s total investment in China amounts to 46 billion dollars .
a high degree of integration between the two countries ' economies has made long-term relations of friendship and peace between Japan and China all the more important , not only for the two countries , but also for peace and prosperity in East Asia and the whole world .
in this context , it is difficult to understand why Japan would see China as a threat .
Japan ' s Chief Cabinet Secretary Hosoda Hiroyuki tried to play down the " Chinese threat " issue .
he told reporters on Friday that the new defense program did not refer to China as a threat but as a country that deserves the attention of Japan in the field of security .
commentary : " strange H@@ int " Of Chinese Threat In Japan ' s Defense Program / First And Last Ad@@ di@@ tion /
however , his explanation did not even convince the Japanese media , which pointed out that it was the first time Japan ' s defense program had mentioned a " Chinese threat , " albeit in an indirect manner .
the Japanese government ' s move to highlight a " China threat " goes against the two peoples ' aspirations for lasting peace and friendship .
the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue expressed China ' s " strong dissatisfaction " with the Japanese move , commenting " this is totally groundless and extremely irresponsible . "
it is well-known that the Chinese are peace-loving people .
a stronger China will not be a threat to any other country . instead , it will be a positive contribution to the development of its neighbors and to regional and global stability and prosperity .
China hopes that Japan can seriously take into account its Asian neighbors ' concerns and exercise caution in security and military security policies .
Japan should stick to the course of peace and contribute to regional peace and development .
it is noteworthy to mention that Japan appears to be following the United States with its security strategy .
it is possible that Japan may be shifting its defense priority to counter-terrorism after the September 11 attacks and to the enhancement of defense capabilities against what it calls the " Democratic Korea threat . "
however , its un@@ bel@@ i@@ ev@@ ably enthusiastic attitude toward a missile defense system in collaboration with the United States betrays its real intentions .
it is un@@ convincing at all that such a missile defense system is designed for the above-mentioned purposes only .

Chinese Scientists F@@ in@@ d Din@@ os@@ a@@ ur@@ -@@ E@@ ating m@@ am@@ m@@ al
Beijing January 13 / Xinhua / According to a report published today , Thursday , Chinese scientists have discovered a f@@ os@@ s@@ ili@@ zed din@@ os@@ a@@ ur@@ -@@ eating m@@ am@@ m@@ al in Northeast China ' s Liaoning Province
the discovery of Hu Ya@@ oming , Wang Yuan@@ qing and Li Chu@@ an@@ k@@ ui , all from the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Pal@@ e@@ on@@ t@@ ology and Pal@@ e@@ o@@ an@@ th@@ ro@@ pol@@ o@@ g@@ y , and Meng Jin from the Museum of Nature in New York , was published in a paper in the British journal Nature .
the f@@ os@@ s@@ ili@@ zed m@@ am@@ m@@ al lived in the Mes@@ o@@ z@@ o@@ ic era .
this discovery revealed that some large size mammals living in that era could have been car@@ ni@@ v@@ or@@ ous and brave enough to compete with dinosaurs for food and living space .
Li said that und@@ ig@@ est@@ ed bones , including teeth and limbs , of a small dinosaur were found in its stomach .
Li added that the un@@ broken jo@@ in@@ ts meant that the m@@ am@@ m@@ al tore and go@@ b@@ bled the prey without biting and ch@@ ew@@ ing
he said that before this latest discovery most scientists assumed that mammals of the Mes@@ o@@ z@@ o@@ ic era were relatively small and no@@ c@@ tur@@ n@@ al .
it was thought that they ate insects and dared not to reach dinosaurs .
Li said that the new discoveries challenged the long-held view and proved that some primitive mammals were larger than medium-sized dinosaurs .
scientists had previously believed that they ate small animals and walked around in daylight .
based on this analysis , the de@@ v@@ ou@@ red dinosaur was one-third of the size of the m@@ am@@ m@@ al .
Russia Se@@ es Final Peace Treaty With Japan As Long@@ -T@@ er@@ m Pro@@ sp@@ ec@@ t
Moscow , January 13 / Xinhua / Russia ' s Foreign Ministry said today , Thursday , that a peace treaty with Japan to formally end enmity between the two nations dating back to the Second World War is a long-term prospect .
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Alexeyev was cited by Interfax news agency as saying , " this work is ongoing and will continue .
it is complicated and may take a long time . "
Alexeyev ' s comment came on the eve of the visit of Japanese Foreign Minister Nobutaka Machimura to Moscow which is expected to pave the way for Russian President Vladimir Putin ' s scheduled trip to Japan later this year .
Russia and Japan still have to sign a peace treaty to formally end wartime hostilities due to an ongoing dispute over four islands to the north of Japan seized by the Soviet Union in the final days of the Second World War .
Russia recently offered to return two of the islands -- known as the Southern Kur@@ il@@ s in Russia and the Northern Territories in Japan -- after the conclusion of a peace treaty , citing a joint declaration signed in 1956 by the Soviet Union and Japan .
Japan has demanded the return of all four islands -- which stretch from northern Japan to the tip of Russia ' s Kamchatka peninsula in the Far East - saying it would lead to signing the peace treaty .
during Machimura ' s visit to Moscow , both sides are expected to discuss the half-@@ c@@ ent@@ u@@ ry@@ -@@ old territorial dispute , preparation work for Putin ' s tour to Japan and bilateral economic cooperation , according to the Itar-Tass news agency .
other issues are expected to be discussed including the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea and Iraq .
