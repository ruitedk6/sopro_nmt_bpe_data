European Commission launches debate on European policy on economic migration
Strasbourg 1-@@ 11 ( AFP ) The European Commission launched today , Tuesday , a consultation process on the possibility of drafting a new policy on the economic migration to the European Union which would aim at meeting the expected shortage of labor as the European society ages .
the consultations will take place through a Green Paper in which all member states , their social partners and non-government organizations will present their suggestions and opinions prior to April 15 , so as to enable the Commission to propose an action plan before the end of the year .
the Commission confirmed that " between 2010 and 2030 , if the current migration levels continue , the working population in the Union ' s 25 countries will decline by 20 million workers . "
" a higher migration level may become increasingly necessary to meet the demands of the European markets , " it added .
the Commission assured that these procedures will not determine the number of workers permitted entry to each country , as this is a prerogative of the national administrations according to the European Constitution project .
the Commission mentioned , however , that permitting foreigners to enter one Union country will affect other Union countries because of the freedom of movement within the Schengen territory , right to benefit from services in other countries , etc .
the Commission suggested drafting unified criteria for migration permits , harmonized as much as possible with the wishes of the member states .
the European Commissioner for Justice , Freedom and Security Franco Frattini is aware that " member states , European Parliament , unions , companies and the many concerned parties have differing opinions on this issue . "
while Italy and Spain support the notion of opening the doors to more migration , German , suffering high unemployment rates , opposes it .
the European Commission had presented a draft memorandum on unification of entry and residency criteria in the European Union for this kind of legal migrants , but it failed .

Iran Den@@ ies News of American Commando Groups in Iran
Tehran , January 19 ( AFP ) - A senior Iranian official denied news reports of American commando groups infiltrating Iran to identify nuclear sites as potential targets of air strikes , Iranian newspapers said today , Wednesday .
the spokesman for the Supreme National Security Council , Ali Agha Mohammadi , said " The entry of American commandos for espionage is not that easy . it would be naive to believe it . "

the New Yorker stated in its latest issue that American commando groups are carrying out secret reconnaissance missions in Iran since summer 2004 , looking for possible nuclear and chemical targets .
although the American Defense Ministry ( the Pentagon ) rejected this report , its publication increased speculations about possible American military action to prevent Iran ' s nuclear activities .

" we do not possess nuclear weapons . the International Atomic Energy Agency has inspected Iran ' s atomic facilities . "
former President of Iran Hashemi Rafsanjani , who is still an influential character in Iran ' s regime , warned the United States on Tuesday on any military action against Iran .
" we are not afraid of foreign enemies ' threats and sanctions , since they know well that throughout its Islamic and ancient history , Iran has been no place for adventurism , " Iran ' s News Agency quoted Rafsanjani as saying .

Abkhazia held a presidential vote on Oct. 3 , when Bagapsh collected 4@@ 3,3@@ 36 votes and Kha@@ j@@ im@@ ba -- 30,@@ 815 votes .
but a dispute over the result erupted between election rivals Kha@@ j@@ im@@ ba , considered to have Russia ' s support , and opposition leader Bagapsh .
Bagapsh , who insists he won the ballot , has claimed he will hold his presidential inauguration as planned on Monday " despite the pressure " .
on Wednesday , Gennady Buk@@ ayev , assistant to Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkov , warned that if any " unconstitutional actions " were taken , Russia would close its border with Abkhazia and take necessary measures to prevent escalation of violence in that region .
Abkhazia self-proclaimed independence from Georgia in the early 1990s following the collapse of the former Soviet Union .
until now no country in the world has recognized Abkhazia ' s independence .
Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili has vowed to regain control over it and another rebel region of South Ossetia .
Iraqi Justice Minister F@@ ears the eruption of Civil War in Iraq
Baghdad , December 5 ( Xinhua ) Iraqi Justice Minister Malik Dohan al-Hassan expressed his fears that a civil war would erupt if the interim government insisted on conducting Iraqi elections as scheduled at the end of the coming January .
in a statement made to the American Radio S@@ awa on Sunday night , Malik al-Hassan expressed his support for the call issued by some of the Iraqi parties to postpone elections until the security situation in Iraq st@@ ab@@ ili@@ zes , and said that in his opinion this was not an appropriate time to conduct these elections .
al-Hassan pointed out that clan leaders and elders from Mosul , Tak@@ rit , Baquba and A@@ r Ramadi have refused to participate in the elections , and called for boycotting them if the interim government rejected the demands of residents in those provinces , namely the division of Iraq into more than one electoral region and the representation of provinces in the National Assembly on dem@@ o@@ gra@@ ph@@ ical basis .
he said that despite there being a desire among the Iraqi people to create an elected government to evict the foreign armies from Iraq , elections could not be held in the current security situation .
the Iraqi Justice Minister explained that the voters ' safety cannot be guaranteed when they will go to cast their votes , and that the candidates ' safety cannot be guaranteed either when they meet their supporters to announce their election programs .
a number of prominent Sunni Muslim politicians had previously urged the government to postpone the elections for six months so as to provide the authorities with enough time to safeguard polling stations and convince the Sunni clerics to desist from their boycotting calls .
a spokesman for the interim Prime Minister Iyad Allawi said , however , that the government will hold fast to the January 30 date after it received confirmation from the Iraqi Elections Commission that elections can take place even in those Sunni areas which were destroyed by the insurgency .
on the other hand , the American President George W. Bush stressed on December 2 that the Iraqi elections must take place on January 30 as planned , pointing out that " it is time for Iraqi citizens to go to the polls . "
African Union Ex@@ presses Its Confidence In Annan
Addis Ababa , December 6 ( Xinhua ) The African Union Executive Council expressed today , Monday , its un@@ shaken confidence in the UN Secretary General Kofi Annan who is currently under fire because of accusations that his son had taken commissions for seven years from a company participating in the oil-for-food program between the United Nations and Iraq .

the Council is expected to discuss today , Tuesday , issues related to the Union ' s budget .
investigations were carried out with the Secretary General ' s son Ko@@ jo Annan for charges of corruption .
the corruption rumors surfaced in January when an Iraqi newspaper published a list of about 270 prominent figures from more than 46 countries , saying they received oil money from Saddam ' s regime .
the list allegedly includes UN official Benon Sevan , who had been in charge of the program . but he vigorously denied the charge .
later , a committee in the American Congress accused the international organization of poor management of the program , and said the organization allowed Saddam to acquire more than 10 billion dollars in oil revenues .
Annan launched an internal inquiry in February but canceled it in March to allow a broader , independent examination .
the oil-for-food program started in December 1996 , to allow Iraq to export 6@@ 9.5 billion US dollars in oil .
the United Nations oversaw Iraq ' s oil sales and its purchase of humanitarian supplies . the program was scrapped in November last year .

Barghouti ' s N@@ om@@ in@@ ation For Presidential Elections Ill@@ eg@@ al : sources
Gaza , December 11 ( Xinhua ) Palestinian sources close to Fatah movement said today , Saturday , that the nomination of the Movement ' s Secretary in West Bank Marwan Barghouti , who is detained in Israeli jails , is illegal .
the sources , who asked not to be named , said that the nomination of Barghouti , jailed in Israel with five life sentences , " breaches a section of the Presidential Elections Act of the National Palestinian Authority . "
" the law stipulates that a nominee for the Palestinian presidential elections has to resign from any office he is holding and present the written resignation to the General Election Commission , especially if they are members of public bodies or security officials , which applies to the members of the Palestinian Legislative Council , " they added .
" the acting speaker of the Legislative Council , Hasan Kh@@ re@@ ish@@ eh , had to retract his decision to run in the presidential elections after the Council members informed him he had the option of remaining a member in the Legislative Council or resigning to run in the elections as stipulated by the Palestinian law , " the sources explained .
the sources confirmed that " the same applies to Barghouti who has announced his nomination without resigning from the Legislative Council . this is a legal breach that prevents him from continuing with his nomination in these elections . "
article ( 10 ) , dealing with the nomination for the position of the President , stipulates that " the provisions established in Article ( 14 ) below shall apply to candidates for the position of President , except for the President of the Palestinian National Authority , " said the sources .

commentary : bizarre indication of " China Threat " in Japanese Defense Program
Tokyo , December 11 ( Xinhua ) The Japanese government unveiled a ten-year defense program on Friday , which g@@ rou@@ n@@ d@@ l@@ ess@@ ly describes China as a potential threat alongside the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea .
while the Democratic Korea has no diplomatic relations with Tokyo , China is a country with which Japan has signed a peace treaty and maintained very close economic ties .
although diplomatic in wording , Japan ' s Defense Program Ou@@ tl@@ ine mentions that China and the Democratic Korea are the only neighbors that pose a threat to it .
" it is necessary to watch China ' s nuclear and ballistic missile programs , the modernization of its navy and air force and its attempts to expand marine activities , " said the document released by the Japanese government on Friday .
China and Japan normalized relations 32 years ago .
in addition to the Treaty of Peace and Friendship signed six years later , the two countries agreed to upgrade their relations to partnership in 1998 .
in the past three decades , trade has increased by more than 130 times and is expected to reach 150 billion US dollars this year .
China might become Japan ' s biggest trading partner in the very near future .
Japan ' s total investment in China amounts to 46 billion dollars .
high degree of com@@ pl@@ em@@ ent@@ ar@@ iness of the economies of the two states has made long-term Sino-Japanese peace and friendship all the more important , not only for the two countries , but also for peace and prosperity in East Asia and the world at large .
in this context , it is difficult to understand why Japan should see China as a threat .
Japan ' s Chief Cabinet Secretary Hosoda Hiroyuki tried to play down the " China threat " issue .
he told reporters on Friday that the new defense program did not refer to China as a threat but as a country that deserves Japanese attention in the field of security .
commentary : bizarre Ind@@ ic@@ ation of " China Threat " in Japanese Defense Program ( first and final add@@ en@@ du@@ m )
however , his explanation did not even convince the Japanese media , which pointed out that it is the first time Japan ' s defense program has advocated a " China threat , " although in an indirect manner .
the Japanese government ' s act to highlight a " China threat " goes against the two peoples ' aspirations for lasting peace and friendship .
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue commented that China has expressed its " strong dissatisfaction " with the Japanese move , and said " this is totally groundless and extremely irresponsible . "
it is well-known that the Chinese people are peace-loving
a stronger China will not be a threat to any other country . instead , it will contribute constructively to the development of its neighbors and to regional and global stability and prosperity .
China hopes Japan can seriously take into account its Asian neighbors ' concern and exercise caution in military and security policies .
Japan should hold fast to the course of p@@ ac@@ i@@ f@@ ism and contribute to regional peace and development .
it is particularly noteworthy that Japan appears to be following the United States in security strategy .
it makes some sense that Japan might be shifting its defense priority to counter-terrorism after the Sept . 11 attacks and to the enhancement of defense capacity against what it calls the " Democratic Korea threat . "
however , its un@@ bel@@ i@@ ev@@ ably enthusiastic attitude toward a missile defense system in collaboration with the United States betrays its real intention .
it is un@@ convincing at all that such a missile defense system is designed for the above-mentioned purposes only .

" we are here to help Afghanistan defeat the terrorist threat and ensure that the future is one of stability and peace , " Mark McCann , coalition spokesman told journalists here .
and we are determined to remain here until our mission is complete . "

" General David Bar@@ no ' s comment simply describes that process and was not an attempt to predict a certain outcome of that process , " he added .
the American commander , he said , was of the view that there were still elements that intend to damage and wish to introduce instability in the country .
the strength of the United States dominated coalition troops has been in constant rise since its deployment in Afghanistan three years ago after the fall of Taliban in 2001 .
Afghan government , as well as American administration , have announced amnesty to Taliban militia but the movement ' s spokesman Abdul Latif Hak@@ imi rejected the offer describing it as a " ploy to divide the militia " and vowed to fight till last .

Turkish Prime Minister Calls For Settlement of Cyprus
Ankara , December 28 ( Xinhua ) Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has called for active measures today , Tuesday , aimed at solving the Cyprus issue .
" Turkey ca n 't protect its interests in Cyprus if it insists on in@@ sol@@ v@@ ability policies , continues to be passive and acts with the strategy of self-defense , " said Erdogan prior to the General Parliamentary Assembly voting on the 2005 budget .

Chinese Scientists F@@ in@@ d Din@@ os@@ a@@ ur@@ -@@ eating m@@ am@@ m@@ al
Beijing , January 13 ( Xinhua ) Chinese scientists discovered a f@@ os@@ s@@ ili@@ zed din@@ os@@ a@@ ur@@ -@@ eating m@@ am@@ m@@ al in Northeast China ' s Liaoning Province , according to a report published Thursday .
the find of Hu Ya@@ oming , Wang Yuan@@ qing and Li Chu@@ an@@ k@@ ui , all from the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Ver@@ te@@ br@@ ate Pal@@ e@@ on@@ t@@ ology and Pal@@ e@@ o@@ an@@ th@@ ro@@ pol@@ o@@ g@@ y , and Meng Jin from the Museum of Nature in New York , was published in a paper in the British journal Nature .
the f@@ os@@ s@@ ili@@ zed m@@ am@@ m@@ al lived in the Mes@@ o@@ z@@ o@@ ic era .
the find revealed that some l@@ arg@@ e-@@ sized mammals living in that era may be car@@ ni@@ v@@ or@@ ous and brave enough to compete with dinosaurs for food and living space .
U@@ n@@ d@@ ig@@ est@@ ed bones , including teeth and limbs , of a small dinosaur were found in its stomach , said Li .
the un@@ broken jo@@ in@@ ts meant that the m@@ am@@ m@@ al tore and go@@ b@@ bled the prey , almost without biting and ch@@ ew@@ ing , Li added .

Russia V@@ ie@@ ws Final Peace De@@ al With Japan As L@@ ong@@ -@@ term Pro@@ sp@@ ec@@ t
Moscow , January 13 ( Xinhua ) Russia ' s Foreign Ministry said today , Thursday , that a peace treaty with Japan to formally end enmity between the two nations dating back to World War II is a long-term prospect .
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Alexeyev was cited by Interfax news agency as saying " This work is continuing and will continue .
it is complicated and may take a long time . "
Alexeyev ' s comment came on the eve of the visit of Japanese Foreign Minister Nobutaka Machimura to Moscow which is expected to pave the way for Russian President Vladimir Putin ' s scheduled trip to Japan later this year .
Russia and Japan have still to sign a peace treaty to end wartime hostilities due to a continuing dispute over four islands to the north of Japan seized by the Soviet Union in the closing days of the World War II .
Russia recently offered to return to Japan two of the islands -- known as the southern Kur@@ iles in Russia and the Northern Territories in Japan -- after the conclusion of a peace treaty , citing a joint declaration signed in 1956 by the Soviet Union and Japan .
Japan has demanded the return of all four islands -- which stretch from northern Japan to the tip of Russia ' s Kamchatka peninsula in the Far East -- saying it is the premise for signing the peace treaty .
during Machimura ' s visit to Moscow , both sides are expected to discuss the half-@@ c@@ ent@@ u@@ ry@@ -@@ old territorial dispute , preparation work for Putin ' s tour to Japan and bilateral economic cooperation , the Itar-Tass news agency reported .
other international issues including the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea and Iraq are also expected to be discussed .
